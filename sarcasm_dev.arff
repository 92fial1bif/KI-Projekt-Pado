382,43_10_R2VXZV548WSF9G.txt,' I \'ve read some of the other reviews concerning this printer discussing noise , print time and paper handling . Well , here \'s me take . I have had the printer for over a month now . The printer is far quieter than the Photosmart 7550 I had before ( it sounded like two monkies with hammers were working inside ) . The 8000 is very quiet to me . I use a PC with the XP op system and it takes a total of 30 seconds to print anything I \'ve printed so far . It usually takes 12 to 14 seconds to initiallize and around 15 to 18 seconds to print the page - whether all text or partial graphics . I \'ve not had any paper handling issues either - though I do just use HP All Purpose paper . I have n\'t tried unusual paper types . Bottom line : if you just want a printer you can count on for everyday stuff then this is the one . ',normal

212,32_16_R1VLASPA4W6WY0.txt,' The main characters in this film have the same names as the main characters in Nicholas Sparks \' novel , but the resemblance ends there . While the film might be entertaining to some , this reviewer found it to be annoying and uninspiring . The Allie and Noah in the book were portrayed as sensitive , intelligent and thoughtful individuals . The Allie and Noah in the film are just two more average , impulsive teenagers with no special or endearing qualities and not a lot of common sense . The reference to the elderly Allie \'s illness as `` senile dementia \'\' is misleading and inaccurate . This reviewer recommends reading the book or listening to the book-on-tape for an inspiring love story and a more realistic and sensitive portrayal of Alzheimer \'s Disease and it \'s impact on the well spouse .

493,11_1_R1R5V05EUS8DQB.txt,' What intrigues me is the number of five-star reviewers who seem to think that folks like me who dislike this book are hopeless , heartless cynics who have obviously never been in love . I might gently suggest that a lot of these reviewers are confusing giddy teenage infatuation with the idea of being in love to real , mature love . Mature love is not about magically finding your one `` soulmate \'\' ( to use the currently fashionable blather ) among the six billion on this planet . ( We \'re supposed to give up Santa and Cinderella at eight . ) Rather , it is about caring , willful commitment to people we occasionally ca n\'t even stand . If , as a number of reviewers have suggested , this book represents deep insight into the `` true heart of a woman \'\' , the feminists must be beyond despair , and there are going to be a lot of disappointed lives out there . What escapes a lot of enthusiasts for this book is that the author is essentially telling the poor drudges over at Iowa Writer \'s to forget their MFA \'s ; if you want to be a successful ( as opposed to great or even good ) writer , get your MBA-marketing . Ironically ( admittedly a distant concept to this author ) , that is exactly the advice philistine Lon would give Sensitive Poet Noah , while Allie sulks petulantly downstage right . Now , that \'s cynicism ! ',ironisch

794,13_9_RZBWQ106KJWIO.txt,' True Blood Season 2 Unless you truly enjoy the idea of wasting a moment of life , in a sedentary moment . Do not buy this piece of crap . If you \'re a Charlaine Harris fan , beware , both seasons bare little or no resemblance to the Book series . They trash the Characters , and remove any semblance of an actual plot/story line . I bought this and season one , sight unseen , which was a big mistake . I recommend renting a copy or borrow one from a friend . To determine if you actually like it , or buy a used copy as scratches can only enhance this trite idiocy . All the stereotypes are here , in regard to southern white folk . If you enjoy lame porn , you \'ll love this . From Anna Pauquin \'s fake tits , to the town orgy , ( oh yeah they went there ) you \'ll really love this waste of an investment . I bought it as a gift for a family member , they wo n\'t let me sell it off on e-bay . As it is a gift . The HBO people should have written their own lame storyline instead of trashing Charlaine Harris . The script writers would make great senators or congressmen as they ca n\'t be bothered with actually reading either . They certainly did n\'t read the book . Queen Sophie is not only too tall , she is too old . The characters do NOT match the book . No plot . A total absence of plot , yep totally gone . Wall to wall brain farts . The best way to view this inane piece of work is through an alcohol induced trance . Then it might actually look well done . They took so many liberties with this , they should have created their own total mess , rather than hacking and butchering Charlaine Harris \'s work . Vampires would certainly not waste as much blood as they did for this photo shoot . There are other glaring errors as well , but too many to list here . Oh and HBO dudes , three letters , CGI , an absolutely wonderful video concept used for special effects , check it out . Shaking the camera while someone is trying to dance poorly is not a special effect . And lacks imagination . Not to mention screwing up a Pagan Myth to the Nth degree . They did get off on the totally black eye effect . Ohhhh , Ahhhh A Hannibal Lectre rerun . Oh my . Gratuitous sex and violence , yep , do n\'t get angry . After all it is only HBO , So having no expectations is a must for entertainment viewing . Just use the mantra ... it \'s only HBO , it \'s only HBO ... Never in my viewing history have I seen something done so damn bad . Actually I lie , I just remembered Captain Apache ( 1971 ) both are about as well done . Imagine a clueless idiot , looking at a Jackson Pollock and thinking ... \'\' Hey , I can improve on this ... \'\' , so he puts paintballs up his butt and farts them out on a canvas ( actually I believe this being done ) , then he thinks this is soooo visionary . It \'s about as imaginative and innovative as the nut who peed in a jar and put a cross in it . Way to recycle bodily fluids dude . And yep , another dummy bought it . So , we have ugly people having orgies , ( I \'m ugly so on the ugly front I know whereof I speak on ugly , never done the orgy thing so not so sure there but a definite yuck . ) , overdone redneck stereotypes , lame gags . At least the first season did have a couple of decent laughs . This series makes old porn movies , hey even new porn movies look positively genius . As it was a gift I was obliged to sit and watch the whole insipid thing . Of course given the other reviews here , I see some actually liked it . Ohhh .... k .

443,18_19_RTJ6PHNHIFR09.txt,' [ Spoiler alert . Nothing overt , but I do touch on the ending indirectly . ] Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie : Q . Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him ? A . So that the audience can identify with her , even though it turns out they \'re best friends . Q . Why does Ringwald \'s best friend disappear halfway through the movie ? A . Because the actress died . But that \'s no reason to keep the scenes she shot , with no explanation of the character \'s disappearance , and then scribble new material for Annie Potts \' record shop supervisor as the new best friend in the second half of the movie . Q . Why does Spader look like he belongs in college , not high school ? A . Because he was clearly too old for the part , although he was otherwise perfect . Q . Speaking of Spader , why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him ? A . Plot point Hughes thought he had to have , but it \'s actually unnecessary . Q . Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald \'s perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful ? A . Because audiences would presumably be repulsed by genuine poverty . ( It \'s also a mystery why she \'s so ashamed of it if she rejects the values of her snobby classmates so vehemently . ) Q . Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie ? A . Because the writer of the novelization knew what the only real logical ending was . Hughes mistook gloss over substance again , as he did in & quot ; The Breakfast Club , & quot ; where Ally Sheedy \'s transformation from quirky indivualist to Barbie doll was supposed to be a good thing . Q . Why , if the characters \' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true , does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun ? A . Because cheap , easy laughs are excused by audiences raised on sitcoms and music videos . Q . Why , if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age , ca n\'t he get into the same nightclub she can ? A . Do n\'t ask me . Q . Why is the father played by Stanton such a weakling ? A . It \'s required in any movie from the late 70s on where a child or teenager is the protagonist . Has there been a parental figure in movies in the last 25 years as charming and authoritative as Ferris Bueller ? Q . Why would anyone hire an actor whose idea of emoting is to press his lips together and bulge his eyes out ? A . Ask Andrew McCarthy \'s agent . Can I recommend anything about this movie ? Yes . Cryer is genuinely appealing in his best role . The soundtrack still kicks . And the climax ( moments before the ending itself falls apart , when you think the right thing is about to happen , before it does n\'t ) is genuinely touching , because Duckie deserves happiness and Andy deserves Duckie .

This book gives plenty of visual details and the writing flows easily . It usually takes me a bit of time to warm up to a book and get to know the characters but this one had me from page one .

565,9_14_RRSI97OZTY5K7.txt,' I \'ve now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad , and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind . First the good sides : This thing is very fast , opening and closing applications is quick , the screen is incredibly responsive , there is no lag while typing , and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages . The not so good sides : As has been thoroughly pointed out , there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS , but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer , and almost certainly by a generation 2 release . That said , it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you \'ll use , and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think . It is n\'t as fast as moving between open apps , but it is n\'t a deal breaker by any means . The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising , while I \'ve purchased my iPad already , I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we \'re probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera . It \'s still an amazing device , but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top , that \'s a feature worth waiting for . The lack of Flash support is n\'t as irritating as I expected it to be , but still something to consider . Many major sites have evolved to html5 , or are in the process of doing so . This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser , and where it exists , it works great . The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist . If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months , but if you \'re mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook ( no Farmville ) the lack of Flash support probably wo n\'t bother you too much . As a laptop replacement : The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality . Do n\'t let that persuade you into believing that you do n\'t need a computer though . You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing , but if you do anything more than that you \'ll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks . That said , this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer , but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with . I have put together a presentation in keynote , which was easy enough to do , but pages is n\'t as intuitive as I \'d have liked , and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard . Battery life seems to live up to the claims , I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20 \% remaining battery life indication , which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use . One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently ( at launch ) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers . The iPad is different than other iPod products , it requires a bit more power to charge up , and unfortunately most USB ports are n\'t set up to support that higher power draw . This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge , or it may simply be that you \'ll need to either rely on a new Mac ( seems like they can handle the power issue ) or rely on the wall charger . Just do n\'t be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it does n\'t show that it is charging . All in all , the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users . For people who need something to really do a lot of work on , you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs . Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation . However , if you \'re an avid reader , casual gamer , music fan , who does n\'t do much more on the web than check a few sites , and e-mail . This thing is definitely worth considering ! If you \'re on the fence , nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now , but it is worthy of your consideration if you \'re thinking you might like a tablet style device . I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it . With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we \'re likely to see some price movement , or a second generation release , so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while . One final note , the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on . It is crisp , bright , and very easy to see from any angle . But when you turn it off , every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible ( while it is on the light is bright enough you do n\'t see them fingerprints ) . If you are a neat freak , or just hate finger prints on your devices you \'ll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve ! In conclusion , it \'s a lot of fun , and I \'m not the least bit sorry to have bought one . It does many things , and over the next months will do many more . If you think you want one , go play with one , and if you do n\'t want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome . If you have specific needs that are n\'t really addressed in this generation or by apple , do n\'t let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one , there are a number of devices coming with great potential , one of those might be a better fit .

54,6_5_RUX5VM463NTXJ.txt,' Published in 1847 , WUTHERING HEIGHTS was not well received by the reading public , many of whom condemned it as sordid , vulgar , and unnatural -- and author Emily Bronte went to her grave in 1848 believing that her only novel was a failure . It was not until 1850 , when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily \'s sister Charlotte , that it attracted a wide readership . And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back . Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature . Even so , WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers . It is not a pretty love story ; rather , it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness . It is cruel , violent , dark and brooding , and many people find it extremely unpleasant . And yet -- it possesses a grandeur of language and design , a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written . The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback . After a visit to his strange landlord , a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family -- which he receives from Nelly Deans , a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights . It was once a cheerful place , but Old Earnshaw adopted a `` Gipsy \'\' child who he named Heathcliff . And Catherine , daughter of the house , found in him the perfect companion : wild , rude , and as proud and cruel as she . But although Catherine loves him , even recognizes him as her soulmate , she can not lower herself to marry so far below her social station . She instead marries another , and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all . WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to `` get into ; \'\' the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting . But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way , setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature , a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations . Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable , both vicious and cruel , and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other . As the novel coils further into alcoholism , seduction , and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone : Heathcliff , driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world -- dragging her corpse from the grave , hearing her calling to him from the moors , escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade , so that she may never leave his mind until death itself . Yes , this is madness , insanity , and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond . It is a stunning novel , frightening , inexorable , unsettling , filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe . Even if you do not like it , you should read it at least once -- and those who do like it will return to it again and again . GFT , Amazon Reviewer ',normal
433,33_16_R2097NO6B8QGI0.txt,' Apparantly my first review was censored by Amazon , so here goes again . This movie is , by far , the worst film i \'ve ever tried to watch . I say \'tried \' because after two separate attempts I couldnt bear to watch more than half of the film . This is coming from someone who gave Eraserhead 5 stars , so take this as a very bad sign . Long story short , Andre is self-absorbed and does nothing but talk endlessly about insignificant , flaky , artsy stuff . For example , imagine the most self-important Art major you \'ve ever met talking about how hot-gluing scraps of trash to a canvas represents the struggle a ham sandwich about to be eaten . Or anything completely nonsensical such as that , that is the level of conversation these men have in this film .

85,42_10_R3R74B0ET6JG8X.txt,' To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor , I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor , a Schick Quattro Power . All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable . I \'ll begin by saying that I \'ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors . In particular , they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean . I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well . ProGlide vs. Hydro 5 Initial impressions : Packaging : Both come in the standard plastic clamshell , but the Gillette is easier to open . The back is perforated for easy opening , where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it . What \'s included : The Gillette comes with only one cartridge , where the Hydro comes with two . Holders : the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder , while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor . You could use the Gillette \'s as a travel holder with no problem . Guarantee : The Schick comes with a money back guarantee . The Gillette assumes you will like it . The razors : While the Gillette looks more substantial , both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded . The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back of the cartridge . Flip the razor 180 deg to use it . The Hydro \'s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer . Cartridge mounting : The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place . The locator pin also acts as `` suspension \'\' for the cartridge pivot . The Hydro is a bit more imprecise . You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge . Not hard , but not as elegant as the Gillette . The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette ... less waste . On initial `` hefting \'\' the Gillette felt better , but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver . The Shave Test All of the above are secondary to the `` Yes , But How Does It Shave \'\' test . I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick , using Proraso Shaving Cream and a badger bristle brush . Shave No . 1 : ( 3 Day Growth ) The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions , with and against the grain . No pulling on the neck or under the chin . The trimmer was easy to use . The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks , but pulled noticeably on the neck , especially against the grain . It left a couple of small `` razor burn \'\' marks on my neck . To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other . Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging . The Wife Test : Immediately after shaving , Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother , but said that side felt sticky . After my face `` dried \'\' she still said the Gillette side was smoother . Shave No . 2 : ( 2 Day Growth ) The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin . The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test . ProGlide vs Quattro Shave Nos . 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro ( with a new cartridge and a fresh battery ) . The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter , where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison . In both tests , the ProGlide performed as before , with no pulling or burning . The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck , but substantially less than the Hydro did . As before , the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B. , tho by a similarly small margin . So what \'s not to like ? The price of the cartridges . Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette . Power ProGlide carts are about $ 4.00 apiece , where Quattro Power carts are about $ 2.50 each . While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave , does n\'t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges . Overall , though , the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars . As a life-long Schick user , I was pleasantly ( and unexpectantly ) surprised by this razor . If you can get past the price of the cartridges , I highly recommend this razor . ',normal

899,51_3_R152RHJ4JNDOI1.txt,' Ever since getting the iPod Touch , I \'ve had an extreme case of iPhone envy ; the Touch \'s intuitive interface , sleek design , and overall pleasant experience made me wish I could use it on the go , and not be tied down to Wi-Fi networks . As a happy Verizon customer , however , I was not going to switch providers just to get a new phone ( although the thought crossed my mind more than once ! ) . After a long wait , I finally got my hands on an iPhone competitor , the Motorola Droid . While it might not be the `` iPhone Killer \'\' that people have claimed it to be , it \'s a great phone in its own right . CALL QUALITY For some reason , I get fewer service bars/seemingly weaker reception compared to my LG Dare . In the same spot , holding both phones , I get 5 bars on my Dare ( which I \'ve since given ) , while I only get 2 bars on my Droid . Weird , but fortunately I have n\'t actually noticed any decline in call quality or reliability ; it \'s been superb ! SPEAKER Loud , and good quality ! This is important , because whether you \'re listening for driving directions using the built-in GPS , streaming music through Pandora , or talking , the speaker is very loud and clear . BATTERY LIFE Decent . Yes , the battery can run out quickly , but that \'s just because you \'ll find yourself using the phone so much ! Some of the biggest battery drainers I \'ve noticed have been screen brightness , GPS , and streaming radio . These problems can be resolved by turning down screen brightness ( even at its lowest setting , still bright and crisp ) , turning off the GPS when it \'s not in use ( through the Power Control widget ) , and not relying exclusively on streaming radio for music ( with the included 16GB card you can store plenty ! ) DISPLAY Gorgeous , crisp , and very bright display that makes other phones pale in comparison . I love it , and highly recommend those considering this phone to take a look at one in their local Verizon store . Even at its darkest setting , its very good . The high-resolution display also allows for text to appear much more detailed and crisp , a plus for those with glasses . CAMERA The Droid packs a 5 Megapixel camera , as well as video-recording at roughly DVD-quality . The camera is a bit slow to auto-focus , but pictures come out fine . Not great , but decent for a cell phone , especially at night using the flash . While its still pictures do n\'t come out great , the Droid \'s videos come out really well . The audio recorded on videos is also really good . LOOK AND FEEL The phone is n\'t light , but it also is n\'t as heavy as I feared based on initial reviews . The only criticism is that there are no dedicated call/end buttons ... instead , you have to rely on the phone application , which means you ca n\'t feel around for the call/end buttons , say you get a phone call in the middle of the night . Still , that \'s just a minor gripe . The phone feels sturdy , not cheap , and is pretty slim considering it packs a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard . KEYBOARD One of the major selling points of this phone was that it has a physical keyboard . The keyboard is n\'t perfect - keys are shallow , too close to one another , and there is n\'t a dedicated row for numbers . Also , the top row of keys is inconveniently located too high to the top of the phone . Still , despite these shortcomings , I would not use this phone without the physical keyboard . After a year with the touchscreen-only LG Dare , I still had difficulty with typing , and even after 2 years with an iPod Touch - which has a much better touchscreen keyboard than the Dare - I have difficulty with typing on that , as well . While the touchscreen keyboard on the Droid is very good , I still make many fewer mistakes with the physical keyboard than with the touchscreen one . While I \'d say this is largely a matter of personal preference , I \'d like to emphasize that the physical keyboard is n\'t nearly as bad as some reviewers online made it out to be . Android Market As it stands now , the Android Market has over 10,000 apps , while the Apple App store has over 100,000 . As a result , some reviewers have said - wrongly , I believe - that the Droid is somehow more limited . One should remember that while the iPhone/Touch had a headstart in developing its application market , many new developers have flocked to Android as more phones have come to market . There already is a strong selection of apps , and this will only grow over time . SHORTCOMINGS The two major shortcomings of this phone - especially when compared to the iPhone - are that : 1 . Not as intuitive as the iPhone . I think this phone is great for many users , but others might find it to be a little complicated . This phone is very capable , but sometimes to find things you have to dig around a bit more than might be convenient ( I do n\'t mind this too much ) . 2 . No widespread and easily available alternative to iTunes . I use DoubleTwist , but without a doubt iTunes is a much easier way to transfer media to the phone than dragging and dropping or using iTunes alternatives , for most people at least . While I do n\'t buy MP3s online , others have also pointed to the iTunes store offering much more selection than Amazon \'s MP3 store . CONCLUSIONS Who should get this phone ? If this is your first smartphone , you might find things to be a little difficult at first , but well worth the patience . While this phone is n\'t for everybody , if you are already on/hope to switch to Verizon , this is without a doubt one of the strongest offerings . I do n\'t know if I would necessarily dump my iPhone if I were an AT & T Customer , but I think that this phone will be a very useful tool for many people who have considered an iPhone but wanted a physical keyboard , more customizability , or more Google integration . While there are a few shortcomings in design and media integration , I can now say I \'ve found the cure to my iPhone envy ! * * UPDATE 2.22.10 * * I wanted to say that while I \'m still very happy with my Droid , one problem has arisen . For some reason , text messages I compose are not always going through ... after minutes of trying , the phone simply notifies me saying that the text message was not sent . I have no clue why this is happening , but must say it is a bit frustrating . Fortunately , it does n\'t happen too often , but it has happened enough to notice . This has happened to text messages I \'ve sent to people on different carriers , so I \'m assuming the problem is from my end on not the recipients \' . Either way , a small price to pay for an otherwise amazing phone . ',normal

121,48_6_R3T0FQCSQC7VDP.txt,' When I dislike a book , I often do n\'t dwell on it , because what \'s the point , right ? But my reaction to this book went BEYOND dislike , and I felt I had to vent about it a little bit to get it out of my system . This book was horrible . Absolutely horrible . I bought it because it was featured in a magazine I read , and I \'d heard good things about it , so I decided to give it a try ... as a die-hard fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and fantasy literature in general , I thought it was right up my alley . I was wrong . First of all , I was * disgusted * by the main characters . I actually think one can dislike a character and still like the book/writing , but in this case , the main characters were pathetic and boring . The female lead ( Bella Swan . Really . Bella Swan . Why not just call her Pretty McPerfect and have done with it ? ) is completely vapid . She has no goals , no dreams , no ambition , no personality aside from being miserable and obsessed with her boyfriend . Now , ok , it \'s romance . Fine . But romance can be accomplished ... and often in a better way ... if the participants have strong , defining character traits . It heightens the tension and makes the results much more satisfying . Bella had no defining character traits . I do n\'t even remember what she was supposed to look like . She was selfish and misanthropic for absolutely no reason , and she acted like a spoiled martyr for far too many pages . It \'s really quite depressing that this book is being touted for teenage girls , because the main character is a HORRIBLE role model in every sense of the word . Why not portray her as having goals ? Dreams ? Ambitions ? It would serve to heighten the conflict and make the book better in the long run . But anyway . The love interest , superhot vampire Edward , is downright scary . And not in like ... the good way . He stalks her . He makes decisions for her . He does n\'t listen to her views or opinions ( not that she has any , really ) . He encourages her to lie . He puts her in danger ... no matter how many times he whines about the emotional toll it puts on him , he still does n\'t stop putting her in danger . He is cruel and arrogant . AND SHE ACCEPTS THIS ! He keeps telling her how she needs him to look after her , how she would die or something if it was n\'t for him . AND SHE IS NOT OFFENDED/ANNOYED BY THIS . Seriously ! Even the most ambivalent feminist should find this insulting and derogatory ! There \'s absolutely no chemistry between the leads . She loves him because he is beautiful . He loves her because he wants to eat her and she smells good . Really . He tells her she is like his heroin . How is that in anyway healthy ? She is willing to die for someone she barely knows , someone who plays mind games with her , who dominates her completely . She admits to being completely obsessed with him . And there are no consequences for this ! She has no doubts about her emotions toward him ! Ugh . I could go on , but I wo n\'t . I just want to say that this is probably the worst book I have ever read , and I \'m not too far removed from the teen audience this book is geared to . I see no redeeming features at ALL , except perhaps the character Jacob , who seems like the only person in this entire book that has any interesting and healthy character traits . But now that I \'ve gotten this out of my system , I do feel better . In short ... please do n\'t read this book . Please . ',normal
210,27_3_R20PSFN13OIUD3.txt,' Kevin Smith \'s first directing gig that he did n\'t write himself , `` Cop Out , \'\' finds the director re-teaming with his Live Free or Die Hard co-star , Bruce Willis , as well as Tracy Morgan and Seann William Scott , who were both featured in his 2001 film and quite possibly the biggest inside-joke put to film , Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . More than that , though , the film is a brilliant throwback to the glory days of such 80 \'s buddy cop franchises as Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop . You \'ll recognize key dialog from the former while the composer for the latter , Harold Faltermeyer , makes a glorious return to the genre with a quirky retro score that sets the mood just right . Bruce Willis plays the straight-man to Tracy Morgan \'s ... well ... Tracy Morgan is really just playing every character he \'s ever played here , but the way in which he bounces off of Willis ( who himself seems to be trying hard to keep a straight face in many scenes ) keeps it from feeling tired or stale . While this odd-couple/cop formula has been done to death in the past , it works for this film and is done in a loving way that pays tribute rather than re-hashes . Smith , whose films are mostly talk , proves himself to be a competent action director at times throughout the film . It \'s funny to think that the man who made Clerks made a polished studio film such as this , but it \'s a sign of maturity more than selling-out , so rest easy fanboys . The script by Mark & Robb Cullen is whip-smart , witty and never leaves you longing for a laugh . Even if you do n\'t gel with the story about a rare baseball card landing into the lap of a high-powered drug-lord , you \'ll always find yourself laughing along with the film . It also helps , too , that each and every player seems to have had a good time making the film , and that translates into the final result . One could make the argument that Smith himself could have re-written the film and made it all the funnier , but much of the humor in the film comes from the on-screen chemistry . It \'s about as good of an 80 \'s buddy cop throwback as you \'ll get , and is rounded out with a brilliant cast that also includes Guillermo Diaz , Kevin Pollak , Adam Brody and Jason Lee , among others . Go into expecting a simple yet effective way of just how fun an action movie can be . As for Smith , he \'s shown significant range , and hopefully the film will help break him out from just being the guy who directed those Jay & Silent Bob flicks . Thankfully , `` Cop Out \'\' is anything but . ',normal
881,26_9_R3UEDN9A3ECS2O.txt,' Little Women was my favorite book as a child , and I still re-read it at least yearly as an adult for the comfort it gives me . I \'ve probably read it 50 times over the last 30 years . I have also seen every filmed version of the book that I could , and was never completely satisfied . I held my breath as this version of the story rolled onto the screen . I was enchanted . It was all there , from the scenery to the costumes to the characters . Winona Ryder perfectly captured my fiery Jo , Kirsten Dunst the vanity of Amy , and Clair Danes the real depths of Beth , without any of them becoming a caricature . I loved the way Trini Alvarado , an actress new to me , potrayed the earnest , wistful , practical Meg . The passionate , fun-loving yet moody Laurie was perfectly found in Christian Bale , and the only difference between Gabriel Byrne and the professor I \'ve always imagined is that Gabriel Byrne is more handsome . Aunt March had more dimensionality to her than in the book ( and what a joy to see Mary Wickes in the role ! ) . But the spirit that Louisa May Alcott gave to her book was caught ethereally in Marmee , as portrayed by Susan Sarandon . She was the real foundation of the film , and expanding her character was the wisest decision Gilllian Armstrong made . Yes , some of the things in the film were not in the book , but they were so consistent with the story , so central to the March family philosophy , that perhaps they should have been ! I never thought that my beloved book could be improved upon , but it has been in this film . I also wish to mention the sets , the cinematography and the music , all which added so much to make my imagined world of Meg , Jo , Beth and Amy become real . Thank you to everyone who worked on this precious film . ',normal

855,25_18_R3LAM0V39900Q5.txt,' I was on the fence about spending $ 600 on a solid crib or this one . I finally decided on this one because as it turned out , the expensive Sorelle also used cam-locks on most of their cribs . So that was the deal breaker . The Kalani is sturdy despite the few cam-locks . Grandpa had no problem with the assembly and finished within an hour . This is for my 3rd child as I converted the old one already . Features that were hard to find in one crib but offered in this one : 1. rich cherry finish that complements other cherry furniture in the baby \'s room . 2. heavy and sturdy 3 . 4 height settings . Perfect for a shorty like me to easily set down a sleepy baby . most cribs only offer 3 settings that are either too far apart or does not make much of a difference . 4. mattress springs . i do n\'t like slats or MDF panel to support my bouncing baby boy . slats are a pain to adjust and MDP could slip and slide around . 5. toddler rail is included , which saves a hundred bucks . 6. converts to a head and footboard sleigh bed . Cons : Nothing for the crib . But I would not spend $ $ on the furniture accessories from DaVinci . $ 400 bucks for baby size dressers ? MDF and cheaply made ? I would recommend going to a furniture store and purchase a real dresser for less or at least comparable that will outlast the crib stage . I have Broyhill dresser , chest , and nightstand for his room that matches the crib and I know will last after he \'s done with the crib ( off to college and converted back to a guest room ) . Another recommendation : corner changing table in cherry . I do n\'t recall the brand but the color match is great and can be used as a credenza once potty trained . fits nicely in a corner , does not take up much space . I do n\'t like the DaVinci changing table as it looks silly to use it as anything else with that immovable side rail . Crib bumper : PBkids- super thick and \'cushiony \' or RHbabyandchild- cover removes for easy washing . I \'ll post a photo once all the decor is up . So , good luck and congrats on the new baby !

1172,17_18_R3W387NTMCSMPP.txt,' I must say that I was initially excited about this book . Knitting with dog hair seems like one of those ideas that every pet-owning , recycling , energy-conscious responsible human being should subscribe to . However , one little thing you should be aware of before you get this book . You have to REMOVE the hair from the dog BEFORE you knit . I really wish I had been told this before I started . Sure Scout makes a great hat , but it \'s really embarrassing if you are walking down the street , wearing your admittedly very stylish chapeau , and the hat pees down the back of your neck . Believe me , after the sixth or seventh time that happened I realized there was something wrong .

481,6_4_RU2MP6GK6P1C1.txt,' This Korean film by director Kim Sung Soo is a visionary masterpiece that brings to mind `` Braveheart \'\' and `` Gladiator . \'\' It takes place in ancient China , where Korean missionaries are betrayed by the Chinese and are taken into the desert to die . The Mongol hordes annihilate the Chinese guards and leave the Koreans to their fate . While wandering , the Koreans discover the Mongols have kidnapped the Chinese princess , and decide to rescue her and take her to safety . This is easier said than done , for the Mongols fight back with all the ferocity in their blood . Zhang Ziyi is the most known star in this film , but she is hardly the main character . There and great performances by Jung Woo Sung as a quiet loner and Ahn Sung Ki , the skilled archer who gives Legolas a run for his money . The scenery filmed in China and parts of South Korea is grand , and the battle scenes are filmed with finesse and brutality . Limbs are hacked off , arrows puncture necks , and heads are severed . This film is somewhat gory , so be warned . This film was the biggest budgeted Korean film in history at the time of its release , and it was a box office hit in South Korea . It is a wonder why this film was never released commercially in the States , when it is on par if not far superior , to the films made in Hollywood .

498,16_3_R1BHO3XTFFAB84.txt,' Since taking delivery of my pen I have been very happy with the quality of ink deposition on the various types of paper that I have used . On the first day when I excitedly unwrapped my pen ( thanks for the high quality packaging Amazon ! ) I just could n\'t contain my excitement and went around finding things to write on , like the shopping list on the notice board in our kitchen , the Post-it notes next to the phone , and on my favorite lined A4 pad at the side of my desk . My pen is the transparent type with a blue lid . I selected this one in preference to the orange type because I like to be able to see how much ink I have left so that I can put in another order before I finally run out . When the initial excitement of taking delivery of my new pen started to wear off I realized that I should n\'t just write for the fun of it , this should be a serious enterprise , so by the second day of ownership I started to take a little more care of what I wrote . I used it to sign three letters , and in each case was perfectly happy with the neatness of handwriting that I was able to achieve . I have a helpful tip for you that you might not know about - if you let the ink dry for a few seconds you can avoid the smudging that sometimes happens if you rub the ink immediately after writing . Fortunately the ink used in this particular Bic pen seems to dry very quickly . On the third day of ownership I went on a trip to London and took my pen carefully packed away in my brief case , but I need n\'t have worried , this is n\'t some temperamental ink pen that leaks when you store it at the wrong angle . I sat at my meeting and confidently removed the cap from my pen and it wrote flawlessly , almost immediately . I notice that the barrel of the pen has been crafted very carefully to fit in the pen holder down the edge of my Filofax . It \'s not so grippy so that it is hard to remove when I want to make a quick note , and yet not so loose that it falls out too easily when I open my Filofax in a hurry . Maybe the choice of surface texture on the pen has some part to play here , because it seems that the inside of the leather grip on the pen holder in my Filofax has just the right level of adhesion that I can be confident when I need to reach in and get my pen it \'s going to be just where I left it ! Today is the fourth day of ownership of my pen , and I have to say I \'m starting to treat it like an old friend . I walk around the office with it clipped in to my shirt pocket and someone in the accounts department actually asked to borrow it while we were both standing at the photocopier . Would you believe it , they actually tried to walk away with my pen ! They were very embarrassed when I called after them as they walked down the corridor and asked for it back . You will be happy to know that it is now back , safe and sound in my top pocket , ready and waiting to start writing again . In summary , I would happily recommend this pen to anyone who is planning on writing on paper . If you are considering a writing implement for some other surface such as writing on a CD , or other non-porous substances then another pen might be better suited , but if it \'s just plain old paper then I think you will probably be well served by this particular model .

952,8_12_RGF95TBVUE0GA.txt,' I found this book very interesting . I \'m British , but I take an interest in American politics . In this book ex-FBI agent Gary Aldrich relays his impressions and experiences of the Clinton White House . AS is obvious from some comments in reviews here , the fact that the book has the political arena as its background means some strong reactions will be stirred almost by default . But I did not find Aldrich was trying to score political points . His is actually something of a matter of fact analysis of more nuts and bolts issues surrounding the functioning of the White House . And he obviously cares very much about the dignity , efficiency and security of the place . And indeed , through his work he is obviously very knowledgeable about it . Which was one reason I found the book interesting , because it allows a glimpse into some of the basic mechanics of the place at the centre of American politics . But even though I guess political loyalties will be fired up , it is quite plain to me that the book transcends these , and is in fact about what endures in the system of government beyond them . And although some individuals might get hot under the collar because of political considerations , nevertheless I suggest persons of any political persuasion should really be able to see the issues run deeper . As for the reliability of the book , surely , the obvious basic fact of the matter is that Aldrich is an eminently credible and authoritative source . His job was to dispassionately and meticulously assess character in the highest office in the land for the sake of the standing of that office . A job he evidently took pride in , took very seriously indeed , did well and was respected for . It \'s obvious to me the man had Public Servant written all over him . I suggest he has proven a faithful servant to his nation . I do not sense political opprtumism in this book , but moral courage . Aldrich seems to me to be a decent guy who felt it wrong to just shut up . And in so doing he offers an affirmation of the existence of bedrock decency in law enforcement agencies , itself no small matter . I ca n\'t imagine he took the decision to publish lightly . It seems there was something very wrong in the corridors of power and Aldrich felt duty bound to alert the country . No matter what actual political persuasion Aldrich himself may have , this book is not in itself about that , and I think it \'s only reasonable to recognise this in assessing it . I think the book is actually well written , which is part of its effectiveness . But it \'s not the fancy writing of the novella , its that of the informed , matter-of-fact report . Aldrich cuts to the chase , and his style is fluid and concise , making it very easily readable . I highly recommend it . It obviously raises specific concerns , but more than that I think it raises fundamental questions about the nature of government in the USA ; questions , for instance , pertaining to distinctions between process and personality , important issues when considering the mechanics of democracy .

My only real complaint is that unlike the previous Lego DS games you CAN NOT use the buttons on the right to perform any of the spells like you could in the Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones games to perform stunts , punch , etc . For this game you must use the stylus because of how the `` spells \'\' are performed . I found it a little annoying at first , but now it seems completely natural . And since you need the stylus out to do any of the spells you find it is easier to `` guide \'\' Harry or whoever around the game instead of using the directional keys to walk your character around like in the previous games . I can see this being where the dizzy feeling can occur until you get used it .

These products encompass a wide range of price points . The one I bought was the Vizio : great sound and convenience at a price near the bottom of the range . The wireless subwoofer is an amazing convenience . Its range is at least 20 feet , and it sounds terrific in a variety of placements . I connected the soundbar to my HDTV console with an optical cable , which works extremely well with one caveat -- to activate the audio , the TV must be set on a digital channel . After that , analog audio ( including from a DVD player ) comes through as normal . If you use the included conventional cable , no issues . You have limited control options to tailor the sound , but that \'s to be expected at the price . Vizio uses SRS Labs \' surround virtualization chip and also throws in its volume stabilizer to knock down loud commercial breaks . This is a cost sacrifice , as the Dolby and DTS HD audio codecs are much more expensive . No problem ; the others sound thin , while the Vizio washes you with clear , powerful sound .

1169,18_13_R6I266UPV2E85.txt,' This book , nearly 800 pages , analyzes in exhaustive detail Ken Starr \'s investigation as independent prosecutor of President Clinton . Two things stand out about this book . First , the colossal amount of research that went into it . Gormley interviewed not only all the major players in the events , including Starr , Clinton , and Monica Lewinsky , but also hosts of minor characters , relatives , attorneys , and the like . I have rarely read any book on any subject that interviewed so many different people in so much depth , many of them ordinarily difficult to find . Gormley \'s extreme diligence pays off as he uncovers tragic but mesmerizing details that are not widely known . For example , he has a detailed account of Jim McDougal \'s death in solitary confinement including information based on his interviews with McDougal \'s prison psychologist . He also uncovered a report highly critical of the prosecutors \' interrogation of Monica Lewinsky , which criticizes the prosecutors for continuing to question her after she had requested an attorney . What was particularly interesting is that the report was never released because , allegedly , its release would have violated the privacy , not of Lewinsky - but of her prosecutors ! One of the most interesting features of this book is that while the FBI was devoting enormous investigative resources to the question of whether the president committed perjury in his Jones deposition , Clinton was sending missiles against al-Qaeda threats in Afghanistan . Some of the participants expressed exasperation that law enforcement did not consider anti-terrorism investigation a higher priority than the Jones deposition issues . The second great thing about this book is that it \'s so clear and easy to read . Although it covers events over twenty years , innumerable legal proceedings and lawsuits , it \'s paced so that it \'s nearly impossible to put down . It \'s one thing to collect all this information , but the author also managed to have it tell an incredible tale : at times tragic , at times infuriating , at times laughable - but always fascinating . Nevertheless , the book had a few weaknesses . One omission generally was that the details of the legal arguments tended to be glossed over . For example , there is no analysis of Clinton \'s arguments that he did not commit perjury in his testimony in the Paula Jones deposition , which are important to understand the merits of his defense . In general , the author sometimes appears to conflate similar terms for specific acts in ways the confuse the issue about perjury . As the legal discussion , on page 172 the author describes a bill that would allow certain private litigants to sue sitting presidents as one that would `` almost certainly have violated the U.S. Constitution \'s command against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws . \'\' This statement seems too strong . Ex post facto laws do not ordinarily circumscribe civil liability , and a bill as described could probably be drafted so as to withstand a bill of attainder challenge . I would also have wanted to read a more detailed analysis of the legal arguments of Clinton v. Jones or Morrison v. Olson , the two key cases that led to the scandal . Interestingly , the author does include an interview with a Supreme Court justice defending the claim in Clinton v. Jones that allowing a private lawsuit against a sitting president would be unlikely to be distracting . Although the author suggests at one point that Justice Scalia supported the independent counsel , it would have been interesting to note that Scalia was the lone dissent in Morrison v. Olson , the case authorizing the law . Indeed , Scalia predicted , in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson , that the independent counsel law would gravely damage the republic because it violated the separation of powers . The writing itself is excellent . It \'s clear , well-paced , and hard to put down . Still , there were some issues in the way of copy editing . On pages 88 and 554 the author misuses `` bold-faced \'\' in the phrases `` bold-faced liar \'\' and `` bold-faced deception \'\' . Even if this unfortunate usage has been sanctioned by popularity , it \'s still better to use `` bald-faced \'\' instead . The author similarly misuses `` fulsome \'\' to mean `` full \'\' on pages 135 and 567 ( `` draft a more fulsome four-count complaint \'\' ; `` Starr had taken in compiling a fulsome report . `` ) . Some readers may find that portions of the book take a more supportive view of the independent counsel than the narrative suggests , but since the narrative contains the facts for the reader , the treatment can not be said to be unfair . In conclusion the book is well-written , well-researched and interesting . It \'s a superb example of journalism and an important contribution to the literature . ',normal

371,4_14_R1EJS9Y17TR72G.txt,' If you \'re thinking about buying a subwoofer , it is unlikely that you are a garden variety movie fan or lover of music . People looking for subwoofers usually already have a decent system , but know that there is something lacking . When it came for me to buy one , three factors weighed in my decision : power , brand , and ( of course ) price . I \'ve grown up with what I have always believed to be a \'healthy skepticism \' when it comes to Sony products . My father had an early generation ( 1990ish ) 5.0 Sony 250 Watt surround amp that performed extremely poorly in just about every function . The only advantage it had over his earlier ( 1978 ) Rotel non-tube amp is that it had multiple component inputs . The sound quality of the 50 Watt rated Rotel amp blew the Sony out of the water . In my search for a subwoofer , I was surprised to find so many good reviews of the Sony line . I was looking for a better name than Sony , but when I compared prices , I was compelled to give the Sony at least a listen . Comparable subs by Velodyne and others were far more expensive ( double the cost of the Sony or more ) . Listening to the Sony at the stereo shop , I must say that I was extremely impressed . Is the Sony sound as good as the Velodyne or other high end subwoofers that cost 2-3 times as much as the Sony ? Of course not , but I quickly discovered that difference in sound quality was not at all closely related to the difference in price . Keep in mind that this is one of Sony \'s smallest and lightest subs ( only 25 lbs ) , but once I brought it home and hooked it up to my 6.1 surround system and configured the frequency and volume on the back of the sub , it seamlessly expanded the low end range of my system for music and movie playback . Before I learned ( by experimenting with them ) how to adjust the levels on the back of the sub , it was quite boomy and there was a bit of a gap between the low end on the six surround speakers and where the sub picked up . When I made the appropriate adjustments , by trial and error , I found that this sub is an extremely versatile fit for my home . My family room is 17\'x14 \' , and the back opens into a 10\'x15 \' living room , and the sub easily fills the room . When I crank the system for rock and roll music and movies , the sub has no problem keeping up and is easily capable of playing more loudly than is safe or enjoyable . Would I have liked a bigger sub made by a better brand ? Sure , but this one does the job ( and then some ) admirably , and for less than half the cost . This sub gets 4 stars as a product , but I gave it 5 because of the extremely good value . If you have a big budget and can afford to spend what it would take to buy a speaker that actually sounds better than one of these Sony subs , go for it , you will not be disappointed . On the other hand , if you would rather spend less on a sub and still get excellent power and sound quality , this is as good as it gets without spending several hundred dollars . ',normal

The one time you may want to separate them is if the pack is dead and you iphone is close to dead , since the pack needs to get a bit of a charge before it will charge the iphone ...

693,2_8_R3JPQQRABFWLRB.txt,' It \'s without question . This is something all Evanescence fans need in their collection ! I notice this to be something a lot of artists are doing these days , and it probably is just a ploy to cash in , but I personally enjoy live CDs , and especially DVDs , so you can relive the experience or merely feed your curiosity if you missed one of your favorite groups in concert . I have n\'t seen Evanescence in person yet but after watching the DVD portion of \'Anywhere But Home \' , which was taped at a sold-out venue in Paris , I definitely think it would be worth it to try sometime . Amy Lee looks innocent yet deadly , her haunting vocals are in healthy form and the band sounds better than ever whilst they perform their greatest hits ... which is basically everything since their melodies are all so unforgettable .... Many people claim Amy does n\'t sing as well in concert as she does on her studio recordings and though they may be right , take into consideration the fact that she obviously gets really into the songs and because she jumps around so much , which equals exhaustion and breathlessness , I felt she did a pretty damn good job at controlling the words and pacing . You \'ll notice during the songs she sings while sitting at the piano , like on the wonderful Korn cover of `` Thoughtless \'\' , the stunningly emotional `` Breathe No More \'\' , and of course the infamous `` My Immortal \'\' she sounds quite better . Also , during a live event if you mess up there \'s no turning back so be grateful she does n\'t lip synch like countless other acts around . And I \'m so sick of people dissing this group simply because they had a lucky break and hit it big thanks to the \'Daredevil \' soundtrack . I \'m not saying Evanescence is better than similar groups who get far less recognition ( or at least in the states ) like Lacuna Coil , \'cause they \'re not , but they \'ve also been around a while now so their fame did n\'t exactly happen over night . Bottom line is they \'ve got undeniable talent and they are , in my opinion , a blessing to mainstream music which is mostly full of crap . But back to the CD/DVD combo ... Closing the set is the new , or rather recycled track `` Missing \'\' ( originally found on their hard-to-find \'Origins \' CD ) and it \'s a beautiful orchestral ballad , however it \'s the DVD that \'s truly spectacular ! Aside from the concert it also features a lot of bonus material , and it is n\'t just filler either . The behind the scenes is great because you get to see a little of how they are in real life and it \'s not at all boring . It also includes all their videos to date , which are some of the most inventive I \'ve seen in a long time ( `` Everybody \'s Fool \'\' is without a doubt my favorite ) . And for the most part the concepts actually relate to the lyrics . I predict Evanescence will be around for many years to come and I ca n\'t wait to hear their new album set for release sometime next year . ',normal

Kelly is now an in-demand Broadway star and Ozone and Turbo are back home volunteering at their community recreation center .

Eventually , the three of them put together a dance show they hope will save the community center from being demolished to make room for a new shopping center . `` Breakin \' 2 : Electric Boogaloo \'\' was released just 7 months after the first movie . Unfortunately , that short time span shows in this sequel . Like the original `` Breakin \' \'\' movie , `` Electric Boogaloo \'\' is full of 80s style dancing , mainly break dancing as well as poppin \' and lockin \' . And also like the original , this movie shines brightest when the focus is on the dancing . Unfortunately for the movie , and for us , the plot line was expanded this time around . The writing has an awkward feel to it . Every time the dancing pulls you into the movie , the lines that are uttered pull you right back out . In addition , the increased plot highlights the acting inexperience of the stars . If I was to base the rating for Breakin \' 2 only on the plot , writing , and acting , it would only receive one-star . However , once again the dancing is the main star of the show . And if I was to base the rating only on the dancing , it would receive five-stars ( it \'s really that good ) . So a good compromise is in order here , hence the three-star rating . ',normal

Do n\'t get me wrong , I really enjoy good science fiction movies , but this is nothing more than typical Hollywood social commentary wrapped up in a long and boring melodrama with unrealistic and drawn out action scenes . The social commentary becomes paramount to the movie and prevents this from being any more than a simplistic storyline with stereotypical characters who have unimaginative roles . There are no suprises here . No unexpected turns or twists . It almost verges on satire . The movie is supposed to be futuristic , with complex technology , and sophisticated technological operations on planet Pandora . You would think it would require humans with specialized training sophistication as well ; yet the guy running the robotic bulldozer is portrayed as some redneck in in his flannel shirt and baseball cap . The evil money grubbing corporate guy is dressed in a present day shirt and tie , practicing his golf skills in the middle of the operations room .

I thought I could live without having an actual keyboard when it comes to texting , but after a week without my Sidekick Keyboard - I decided to ditch my Samsung Eternity for the Blackberry Bold 9700 . I was hesitant about purchasing this smart phone because I was never a fan of Blackberry \'s ( RIMM ) . I had a BB during their initial boom in the early part of the new millennium . However , the poor browser , poor cell phone network , lackluster screen color , non desirable keyboard , awful battery life , whack OS , & lack of T9 predictive text just could n\'t win me over . After I realized that I could n\'t text on a touch screen phone , unless it was the iPhone . I decided that I must have a cell phone device with an actual qwerty keyboard , if I expect to survive my text message & email addiction . I picked up the Blackberry 9700 with my corporate discount and walked away with a nice high end phone at a very reasonable price . I have to say that I really enjoy the web browser on the new BB . You can zoom in & out with ease . I thought no browser could compare to the iPod Safari besides the Android G1 , but after getting this device - I can safely say that this browser is also one of the best . Its right behind the safari and G1 . Prior models were confined to small screens , thirty-five dollar internet only data plans , and no ability to zoom in or out . You were subjected to a small screen and reading small text till your eyes was squinting like grandmas .

For anyone who has wanted a BB but held off on getting one and want an entry level Blackberry at a decent price - this is the model to get . Everything about it is an upgrade . The device is basically the BB Bold with a different casing . The battery life could still use some more juice . With excessive email checking & non stop texting , the phone usually needs a charge after a day and a half of usage ( Sometimes i can go a charge for 2 days before a charge so thats not bad ) . I did set the brightness of the phone to the lowest brightness available and it has lasted for a little over 2 days with no charge needed . Even on the lowest brightness , the screen is still very bright , sharp , & crisp . And i still do unlimited texting & web browsing . However , AT & T does n\'t offer the best mobile minute plans on earth & their data plan is probably one of themost expensive around . They are fully aware that their signal is one of the best & in doing so , make up for it by charging their non-friendly services at non-friendly prices , which usually does n\'t offers an abundant amount of minutes , unlimited data , internet , email , text etc will end up costing you a lot !

I bought this because it seemingly had three 20-minute cardio segments and I thought I \'d get a great cardio workout . NOT . In the 1st segment , the instructor is primarily running his mouth ( in an attempt to motivate ) and not really participating much in the actual routine .

The viewer is left with a mish-mash of poor technique and a flamboyant instructor running his mouth ( and hovering around the `` boys \'\' ) .

308,276427_2_R3OTADU8DYGPR5.txt,' Glenn Beck is at the forefront of the Republican purity purge . He \'s constantly denouncing this or that GOP politician for deviations from his ideological line .

And yet , he \'s done the reverse here : he \'s tried to claim an icon of the Left as being on HIS side . Tom Paine , whose objection to onerous taxes was a ) that the burden fell too heavily on the poor ( so he proposed hiking taxes on the rich , including a top land tax of 100 \% ) and b ) that it was spent on court placeholders and the war machine instead of being used to help the unfortunate ( `` defense \'\' , meaning offense , is the one area Beck WOULD N\'T cut if he were in power ) . Paine practically _invented_ the redistributive purpose which is precisely what Beck and his ilk hate so much about tax . The Beckbots lap this stuff up .

396,35_14_RBBU3AEO09AQN.txt,' In this short but informative , thought-provoking book , Nicholas Carr presents an argument I \'ve long felt to be true on a humanist level , but supports it with considerable scientific research . In fact , he speaks as a longtime computer enthusiast , one who \'s come to question what he once wholeheartedly embraced ... and even now , he takes care to distinguish between the beneficial & detrimental aspects of the Internet . The argument in question ? - Greater access to knowledge is not the same as greater knowledge . - An ever-increasing plethora of facts & data is not the same as wisdom . - Breadth of knowledge is not the same as depth of knowledge . - Multitasking is not the same as complexity . The studies that Carr presents are troubling , to say the least . From what has been gleaned to date , it \'s clear that the brain retains a certain amount of plasticity throughout life -- that is , it can be reshaped , and the way that we think can be reshaped , for good or for ill . Thus , if the brain is trained to respond to & take pleasure in the faster pace of the digital world , it is reshaped to favor that approach to experiencing the world as a whole . More , it comes to crave that experience , as the body increasingly craves more of anything it \'s trained to respond to pleasurably & positively . The more you use a drug , the more you need to sustain even the basic rush . And where does that leave the mind shaped by deep reading ? The mind that immerses itself in the universe of a book , rather than simply looking for a few key phrases & paragraphs ? The mind that develops through slow , quiet contemplation , mulling over ideas in their entirety , and growing as a result ? The mature mind that ponders possibilities & consequences , rather than simply going with the bright , dazzling , digital flow ? Nowhere , it seems . Carr makes it clear that the digital world , like any other technology that undeniably makes parts of life so much easier , is here to stay . All the more reason , then , to approach it warily , suspiciously , and limit its use whenever possible , since it is so ubiquitous . `` Yes , but , \'\' many will say , `` everything is moving so fast that we \'ve got to adapt to it , keep up with it ! \'\' Not unlike the Red Queen commenting that it takes all of one \'s energy & speed to simply remain in one place while running . But what sort of life is that ? How much depth does it really have ? Because some aspects of life -- often the most meaningful & rewarding aspects -- require time & depth . Yet the digital world constantly makes us break it into discrete , interchangeable bits that hurtle us forward so rapidly & inexorably that we simply do n\'t have time to stop & think . And before we know it , we \'re unwilling & even unable to think . Not in any way that allows true self-awareness in any real context . Emerson once said ( as aptly quoted by Carr ) , `` Things are in the saddle / And ride mankind . \'\' The danger is that we \'ll not only willingly , even eagerly , wear those saddles , but that we \'ll come to desire them & buckle them on ever more tightly , until we feel naked without them . And we \'ll gladly pay anything to keep them there , even as we lose the capacity to wonder why we ever put them on in the first place . Most highly recommended ! ',normal
833,47_14_R1OGD62M2A0DVT.txt,' Here is this product \'s obligatory page-long review . I drew some basic comparisons to two other Verizon phones -- the Samsung Omnia i910 and the LG Dare . I hope this review may ultimately save some of you some time . : ) I have been looking for a phone with a high-resolution , fast camera , and PDA-like features . I use the camera when traveling to clients \' premises , and am surprised how many devices made by Apple , RIMM , Palm and others treat cell-phone cameras as an adolescent feature that wastes the time of employees ( like surfing emails and internet can not be abused this way ) . As someone who needs the coverage of the Verizon network in my area , not too many phones fit into the above two categories -- particularly without the need to buy a $ 30/month data plan . I intentionally delayed using my NE2 , knowing that Verizon often releases phones in June . After nearly choosing the Samsung Omnia i910 and LG Dare , I \'m glad I did . I read in other Amazon reviews that some user \'s of the Sammy 910 made the effort to set the phone up properly so that they did n\'t have to dig through menus . But personally , I found the i910 very difficult to do almost anything , even with shortcuts right on its desktop , even after trying it out 6 times at Verizon stores . I \'d hate to tell a relative , `` Here \'s my phone , go make a call ! \'\' It \'s excellent 5mpix camera almost convinced me , but it was too hard to text in either landscape or portrait , and it requires the $ 30/mon data plan , plus has a non-standard headphone jack . The LG Dare was much simpler to pick-up an use , although ( without having tried calibration adjustments ) I found I made mistakes every time I did a sample text message with it \'s touch screen , in either orientation . The camera was also slow at times , especially when using auto-focus , taking as much as 2 seconds to take a picture , and more to wait for the camera to prompt you with the save/erase options . Enter the enV Touch ( and in some similar respects , the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone , Blue ( Verizon Wireless ) or the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone , Maroon ( Verizon Wireless ) . Finally , a company has figured out a way to keep a real , non-touch-screen qwerty board embedded in an updated , semi-smart phone , especially for those of us who can not or do not like haptic-feedback touch screens . Personally , I prefer the center-located space bar , although some of the older enV user \'s may need time to get used to this . The keyboard , with my fairly large , iron-grip hands , is easier to use than any touch screen keyboard I \'ve tried , and the 3.2 megapixel camera is one of only a few Verizon phones that offers better than 3 megapix resolution -- shameful in my opinion . Pictures snap quickly too , in less than 1 second . The full 3 \'\' screen viewfinder makes you feel as if you are using a devoted still camera , although I \'m noticing that I have to be a bit careful how I hold the phone so as not to cover the sensor . This will improve with practice . But about that front touchscreen -- I am very impressed . Even without a hard keyboard , this would have been the first phone from any US provider where I can actually type out a text message , completely error-free , using only the traditional numeric keypad in portrait mode . And getting there is easier too -- the tab-up feature to use the touch screen is very easy and intuitive . Screen resolution is very good , though perhaps not quite as leading edge as the iPhone or Storm color and resolution . However , the screen is large enough to see the touch keyboard and a large enough portion of a text or email message without having to scroll through as much as with the Dare/Omnia . But the phone is also fast -- my old Motorola motorazr had ongoing slow-responsiveness to pictures , notepad activation , even ringing for incoming calls ! The enV Touch is fastest phone I \'ve used , with a near-instant 1/4th second or better response to opening or activating almost anything . This iPhone-like device also does not require a data plan if you just need a feature-rich cell phone without always-on email . However , at $ 1.99/MB , I will have to try out email push and browsing to see if a data plan may yet be desirable . I travel to Canada frequently , and hope not to have any `` always-on \'\' data roaming fees -- I have read horror stories about iPhones incurring $ 600 bills as owners blithely cross borders or even roaming within the US . But to my current , possibly wrong understanding , I do n\'t think this phone automatically data-roams . The phone also offers airplane mode and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack -- finally , no more need to take an iPod and cell phone and camera with me on trips . Now only if we had unlocked GPS ... maybe this will work with Google Maps ? Another interesting device I \'m looking at purchasing is the Motorola MOTOROKR T505 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone which blue-tooths the phone \'s audio or phone calls to the car stereo -- safer for calls and convenient for music . Another nice change : The CLEAR and END keys on the front screen are well separated now -- no accidentally erasing an unsent message when you thought you were backspacing . It \'s not perfect . Despite the terrific 16GB capacity , Verizon \'s menu system still retains a 200 text-message limit . Wha ? ? After nearly 10 years with this design , could n\'t this be a tiny bit larger by now ? Of course , that \'s a Verizon issue , not really LG \'s mistake , but since this phone is currently only used on Verizon \'s network , it \'s an issue . The phone is a little bit wider at .61 inches than comparable , non-keyboarded competitors . I gladly accept this trade-off for the convenience of two styles of keyboards though . It \'s also little taller than the similar enV3 . So far , that \'s all I can say on the con side . As much as I love the touch screen , it \'s still not what I \'d consider a true iPhone contender though , which with a new release today , seems like it still has a more vibrant display and of course much better apps . But the enV Touch was , for me , the closest Verizon phone to the iPhone , if only because it seems so intuitive , and it is easily the best cell phone I \'ve ever owned . As I use the phone , I will update the review with notable pros and cons . ',normal
269,9_11_R2NCFG5IIH9B5.txt,' ... if you \'re an aspiring writer in need of a primer that gives never-ending examples of what NOT TO DO . I \'m working on a teen fantasy novel of my own , and Meyers \' Twilight series never fails to remind me of the things I want to completely avoid in my own writing . Let \'s consult the list , shall we ? 1 ) THE BORING SUE HERIONE . You may have heard of the Mary Sue , the perfect female protagonist who can do no wrong , who has unnatural beauty , who is beloved by all ; Bella is n\'t quite a Mary Sue . She \'s described ( by herself , at least ) as plain and is endlessly clumsy ( though her clumsiness is so contrived that it seems like a magical Sue ability , practically ) . She also has no interests , hobbies , or anything that she excels at in particular . Despite these flaws , Bella nevertheless ends up a Sue because everyone loves her for reasons that defy explanation or logic . Even when she is behaving in a selfish , whiny , and intolerable way , Bella is never called out for her behavior . The only character who ever seems disgusted by Bella is Jessica , but since Jessica is written as a shrew anyway , we \'re clearly not meant to put much stock in her opinion . 2 ) FATED TRUE LOVE . In my world , Fated True Love is n\'t romantic , it \'s lazy . It says `` hey , instead of working out why these characters are attracted to each other and showing how their relationship develops , I \'m gon na just put it in the hands of FATE and have them fall in love for no reason whatsoever ! \'\' Edward loves Bella because she smells good , which means Edward loves Bella like I love freshly baked bread . Bella loves Edward because he \'s beautiful . God-like . So beautiful ... really BEAUTIFUL , in case you missed it in all the numerous descriptive reminders . But really , why do they love each other ? I have no idea . Shakespeare was all too aware of the ridiculousness of star-crossed love , which is why he was smart and killed his teenaged lovers off . But Bella and Edward \'s happiness hinges entirely on their togetherness . What a strong , solid message to send to the young women of the world : happiness is n\'t something you create for yourself , oh no , it \'s something you can ONLY find in a beautiful , immortal man . Bella \'s slow recognition of Jacob as a potential suitor was far more interesting and realistic , and it was teeth-gnashingly disappointing to see Bella repeatedly insist to herself that no one would ever do it for her again but Edward . 3 ) THE ZERO-HOUR PLOT . Nothing much happens in Meyers \' books , aside from Bella \'s enthrallment/suffering over Edward . In the last few chapters , Meyers will attempt to inject some kind of conflict into the narrative , either in the form of James , Victoria , and Laurent ( `` Twilight \'\' ) or the Volturi ( `` New Moon \'\' ) . It \'s difficult to get invested in this conflict at the last minute , and again feels like a lazy , tacked-on , `` oh right , I am writing a book , maybe something should happen ! \'\' move from the author . Of course , as someone who hopes to be successful at writing teen fantasy , it \'s depressing to know that all I would need to do to achieve this success is construct a BORING SUE HEROINE , a FATED TRUE LOVE , and a ZERO HOUR PLOT . Or maybe it \'s not depressing ... maybe it \'s an incredible relief ! After all , coming up with those three things should n\'t be too hard . If a lazy writer like Meyers can do it , anyone can ! For readers looking for good , solid teen-level fantasy featuring interesting heroines , more complex and realistic portrayals of love , and truly gripping plot , I recommend Diana Wynne Jones and Libba Bray .

131,44_5_R2WU0E5QFJ73TO.txt,' I understand that most of the reviews are fake and I would like to say that while I find them all very enjoyable and humorous , there is a something that a real customer of this product feels should be known . I purchased 10 of the rabbits for the purpose of making hare jerky ( a tasty treat ) when I was overcome with the desire to indulge in a bit of rabbit meat before the smoking process . Giving into my guilty urges , I took one rabbit for my own personal pre-jerky consumption and proceeded to eat the entire animal whole ( I do not own a stove , only a plastic box and some firewood for smoking things , hence it was uncooked ) . After my little personal rabbit fiesta , I laid down to digest the food . This was a mistake . Within two hours , I had never felt worse . I used the trusty search engine `` Bing \'\' to do some armchair medical research while clutching a trashcan in the most horrendous gastric distress you can imagine ( I do not have health insurance so I did not call the hospital ) . Quickly , I found out that a side effect to eating rabbit was `` protein poisoning , \'\' a situation that arises when lean meat is eaten . It is also known as `` rabbit starvation \'\' because rabbit meat contains almost no fat whatsoever . Apparently , consumption of large amounts of protein with little or no carbohydrates or fat is dangerous . Well you imagine how much that tickled me angry . All ready to write an angry letter of protest to the rabbit meat industry about their marketing of a dangerous foodstuff , I stumbled to my writing desk but alas , I only made it 3 feet before collapsing in pain . The next 5 hours were like a blur as I lay on the floor writhing in my own waste seeing people and things from the past and quite possibly the future . I have experimented with drugs back in the day and let me tell you , nothing came as close to disconnecting me from the universe in the worst way possible , as this . No one ever wants to experience protein poisoning , I promise you . At about 10 in the evening I came to and used a chair and the wall to help pull myself off of the floor . I still felt sick and I went back to my computer to see if there was a cure . Suddenly it hit me , I needed to eat other macronutrients ! I remembered the tub of lard I had been saving in the fridge and stumbled across my apartment . The pain only grew worse . I remembered reading that bodybuilders eat lots of protein . I have no idea how they do it . It must be horrible for them . My vegan friend has always said that anything over 20 grams of a protein a day is overkill and I \'m inclined to believe him now . He is the healthiest person I know , he is very skinny but he does n\'t have visible muscle ( which he says is the result of toxins and not enough body fat to properly survive ) . I finally reached my fridge and reached in for the I Ca n\'t Believe It \'s Not Butter container with my stockpiled lard . I quickly shoveled it into my mouth and would n\'t you believe it but it only made me feel worse ! I passed out again , the cold air of the fridge blowing onto me . I awoke three days later ( according to my watch ) at 7 at night . The fridge had apparently preserved my body as it fought the proteins for the first night but now my electricity was off because my bill was due yesterday . It did n\'t matter , my body had apparently started to win the fight around 2 nights ago and now I am pretty much back to normal . However , I SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND RABBIT MEAT as it can potentially kill you , as it nearly did me . Five stars - 1 for nearly killing me - 1 slightly chewy - 1 no head + 1 made great jerky = 3 stars ',ironisch

They are drawn to each other and it does n\'t take them long to realize that they \'ve been in love for years as impossible as it may seem . As the temperatures get cooler , Sam and Grace struggle to keep him human , but the bitter cold and other obstacles threaten to take him away from her forever . What I love about Maggie Stiefvater \'s writing , especially in Shiver , is that it \'s completely seamless : the transitions between the two main characters \' points of view and the way that she brings werewolves into what seems like a perfectly normal world . I \'m one of those people who rarely reads chapter titles or headings because I find them distracting , and not once did I have to glance up at the beginning of a chapter to see who was speaking . Sam and Grace have their own distinct voices and characteristics , but the switch from character to character is not jarring the way I \'ve seen it in a lot of other books . And the coolest thing ? Grace and Sam each have their own strengths and complement each other well . I love to see strong female characters in books for teens , and Grace is definitely smart and strong and can take care of herself . But what I love the most about Ms. Stiefvater \'s writing is her ability to depict chemistry between two characters -- first with Dee and Luke in Lament and now with Sam and Grace . She \'s masterful at showing and not telling : glances , touches , dialogue , and thoughts all create a completely believable love between a girl and a werewolf . Shiver is a perfectly executed book , and I continue to be impressed with Maggie Stiefvater \'s writing . ',normal

183,12_4_R1G4RO7T1KXOD2.txt,' I \'m not usually one to give in to the hype . But everyone keeps talking about this `` tuscan milk \'\' and how it \'s the new macarena . It \'s texas holdem , low carbs , and reality TV all rolled into one . But this is one fad that is sure to last . I bought my first gallon , and not being one for moderation , I ended up drinking the whole gallon one morning . I was just going to drink a glass before work , then be on my way . One glass turned into two . Two turned into a bigger glass . Next thing I know I was sprawled out on my living room floor next to the empty gallon . I stumbled up and made my way out the door , only to arrive at work and meet an angry boss . He said he was letting me go , and I was `` no longer a part of the vision \'\' . I was angry . And very much dissapointed . I loaded my things into my car and drove away . On the way home , my car started sputtering . All the lights came on , and my engine fell out while going down the freeway . I pulled to the side of the road , and started walking . I certainly was n\'t going to call a tow truck , I ca n\'t afford it now . I then got the bright idea to call my girlfriend . Upon answering , I could hear a man \'s voice in the background . She was out of breath , and certainly had just come back from a long jog . I asked if she would come and pick me up , and she said she was `` indisposed at the moment \'\' . I then became more angry , and asked her why not . She promptly dumped me . With my belly still full of Tuscan Milk , I plodded on towards my home . I started pondering why she was leaving me , and entertained the thought that it must have something to do with that man in the background . Who was he ? Why was he there ? Then it dawned on me . The truth , as I had then thought , had arrived . It \'s that damn tuscan milk ! I foolishly blamed the milk for my problems . I lost my job , my car broke , and my girlfriend left me . All in one morning ! I thought the milk was the cause . Hours later , I arrived at my home . `` Nice \'\' I thought , as I spotted the 30 day notice . The thought of now getting kicked out my house kind of made me smile . At this point , nothing could get worse , right ? It \'s not like a gang of ninjas is going to come in and kill my family or something . If you did n\'t catch the sarcasm in that last paragraph , a gang of ninjas did indeed come in and kill my family . Got em all . But still , I dont blame the milk now . You might ask , `` why Jeremy ? why are you so jovial ? \'\' . The answer to that , my friends , is because I \'m days away from becoming a millionaire . This whole situation will be erased . With my millions , everything will change . Fired from my job ? Now I do n\'t need one . Car broke down ? I \'ll buy a lexus instead . Kicked out my house ? To heck with renting , I \'ll buy a new one . Family dead ? I \'ll buy a new one . Girlfriend left ? You get the picture . All my problems are solved ! A few days ago I recieved an email from the prince of Nigeria . I appears their government is collapsing . And they need to move 100 million dollars out of there , STAT . So they researched , searching the world for a top secret , financial mercernary to give the money to , and found me . They must have heard about my skills . So they contacted me . I get , as a commission , ten percent of the take . If you think about it , that \'s a pretty good deal for someone who is saving your country . I \'ve given them the neccessary banking information to the proper agents , and everything should be transferring soon . I will hang out in the park , where I now live , and wait for that phone call . Once I recieve the phone call , the money went through , and you are looking at a ten millionaire . I think I \'ll go purchase some new duds , and maybe head down to vegas and bet ten thousand a hand . I \'ll fly to miami and dig my toes in the sand , or jet off to Hawaii for some fun in the sun . I \'m here at the library surfing amazon , and wanted to order some milk . For some reason my ATM would n\'t go through , kept saying insufficient funds , even though there is money in there . Must be some mistake . I \'m off to the bank to ask them what \'s up , but first I thought I \'d tell you all about the milk that saved my life . RECOMMENDED A+++++++ ',ironisch

28,43_3_RM2PRRDE2PU5D.txt,' Anne Frank : The Diary of a Young Girl tells of a young Jewish girl \'s experiences through adolescence in the midst of World War II and Hitler \'s genocide against her people . On her thirteenth birthday , she was given a diary in which to write her thoughts and feelings . She , her family , the Van Daan family , and Dr. Dussel tried to adjust to life in the Secret Annexe . Her diary , which she named Kitty , was written from her heart with no superficiality . This makes reading it a great experience . She discussed in the book many issues prevalent in her life as a Jew . She talked about the Zionist movement and the hardships Jews endured in Nazi Germany . They could only shop in certain stores designated for Jewish use . She wrote about her father and sister \'s fear of deportation , which would have almost definitely resulted in going to a deadly concentration camp . It is a good read because of the way it intertwines childhood and the Holocaust and speaks of both candidly . She wrote about her feelings and encounters with friends and family . She let out her anger at Hitler and described the new reforms that made her life much harder . She thought she had found a good friend in Kitty .

752,14_9_R1SXRBW2TQZ9L3.txt,' Let me start off by saying that I never met a Douglas Kennedy book that I did n\'t love ! ! This book had arrived a few days ago ( ordered from the UK because it came out there first ) and , each time I passed the table where it was sitting , I actually got a tingle just seeing the name Douglas Kennedy on the cover and knowing that something great was between those covers . I like to think I discovered Douglas Kennedy all on my own many , many years ago when I read The Big Picture . At that time , whenever anyone asked me to recommend a great book , that \'s the one I told them to read . Kennedy followed up The Big Picture with The Job .... another great roller coaster ride of a book . I do n\'t know if something changed in his life at that point because all of the following books were very different . They were specifically about women or couples who were going through major rifts in their lives . As far as I \'m concerned , no one can get inside of the head of a woman like Douglas Kennedy can . I would n\'t want to be his wife . Kennedy writes that `` All novels are about a crisis and how an individual -- or a set of individuals -- negotiates said crises . \'\' In Leaving The World , the main character Joan Howard lives in the world of academia having gotten her PhD from Harvard and is now working as a professor at a New England college . I think Kennedy makes her so intellectually superior so that some of the things she does end up making her look more than intellectually challenged . Obviously doomed by her impulses , Jane finds herself mixed up in one predicament after another . It \'s how she deals with her crises that gives this book the depth that Kennedy \'s readers know he will deliver . She can not stick to anything or anyone and finds herself lost in a world of people who continually leave her . Until one day she decides that she will leave them . This is where Kennedy shines as he now puts Jane in charge of her own life and her own destiny and where we see shades of the excitement found in The Big Picture seeping through each page . While some people might say this book starts out slowly , they would be right because this is the way Kennedy sets the stage for things to come . He wants his reader to be totally invested in his character before he asks them to understand her . When we first meet Jane , it is in the present moment but , like everyone else , she has a back story and it \'s the understanding of this back story that will eventually help the reader to understand why she does what she does . In the book Kennedy says , `` Life can only be lived forwards and understood backwards . \'\' And so we really come to understand more and more what is propelling Jane . There are times in the book where I was screaming , `` NO Jane ... do n\'t do it \'\' , only to have my words fall on deaf ears . Jane \'s life is one of ups and downs never seeming to find that happy medium between living and actually being happy doing so . Kennedy says in the book , `` Unhappiness is n\'t simply a state of mind ; it is also a habit . \'\' Reading this book is a journey as Jane tries to break this habit . It \'s another examination of the psyche of a woman by a master storyteller . In the hands of Douglas Kennedy , it becomes an expedition and one I was happy to take . I know I \'ve quoted Kennedy a lot in this review but some of the things he says in this book had such meaning to me . I leave you with one of the best .... \'\' Conscience is the inner voice which warns us that somebody might be looking . \'\' Well , I \'m now your conscience looking at you and watching to see if you read this book ! ! !

469,17_6_RGHFIPPFW7ALX.txt,' This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read . To begin with , the story is blase , the world is never described , even the main character and her & quot ; powers & quot ; are not properly explored . The writing sounds like a cross between a smarty pants teenager with the fantasy of a nine year old wrapped into a very uncreative roleplayer who wanted to make a one-dimensional character fly into our hearts . WRONG . Even the writer losses her own consistency . Halfway through the story , I \'m reading of the events taking place through a Saturday , and what happened to the characters earlier that morning was described as happening the day before . Am I the only person with it ? How could the author and the editors have missed such a thing ? All the characters actions were misplaced and the reasons , unmotivated . If you want to bore yourself , and spend the 7 bucks it takes to read to the witless dialogue and waste the rest of your time trying to grasp the very underdevloped world of Hamilton \'s , please go to the library , or else you \'ll hate yourself .

653,25_11_R56GPRIKRCW7H.txt,' First off their is no IDE or PS/2 connections so be ready for that . After I got everything in my computer put together and ready to go I went to plug in my keyboard and it was usb only . So just find yourself an a adapter or get yourself a new keyboard . The price of DDR3 is cheap so its not so much a big deal to invest in . There is one PCI slot and now with the newer BIOS update its SLI compatible which is great since when I read the description it says that its only Crossfire ready . If you want to go with something beyond two way SLI than you may want to go with the EVGA model which has more DIMM slots as well . I was going to go with EVGA but my new case would not allow it and I do n\'t have the budget for three cards . I like the way the board is situated with DIMM slots running vertical and looks like everything is closer to the processor than on other boards I have seen . I guess when everything is moving at light speed a smallest measurement closer makes a difference on a motherboard . Install is a cinch just make sure you take your time and do n\'t rush and make a stupid mistake . I have found that in my experience I mess up on stupid things instead of something big . Overclocking has been a little more simplified on this board which is what you should probably do if you invest in these boards . Overall this board has everything that I need with lots of SATA and USB ports and its super fast with my i7 920 along with my 6 Gigs of Corsair Dominator DDR3 . All I can say is I ca n\'t wait to get my hands into some overclocking when I get the free time . Keep in mind only 64 bit Vista will see anything above about 3 and a half gigs so if you do n\'t want 64 than just be ready not to see what you put in . One minor issue is the setup of the PCI Express slots since I have an 8800 GTS ( one of the fatties ) and a Creative X-Fi sound card it does n\'t leave room for another 8800 GTS without me having to remove my sound card . Its not that big of an issue though since I plan on getting a smaller newer card anyways . Though if you have a fat card like me and something in the PCI slot and want to run SLI you might run into trouble so that is worth noting in my mind . Is this board worth it though I would have to say absolutely yes . According to Intel sticking in a fourth stick will cause a degrade in performance so since most ram that \'s DDR3 come in three packs its not so much a big deal . Also when it first came on and I entered BIOS everything was recognized but I could not get the thing to boot my ROM drive and it would just sit there with a black screen and then it would ask me to select cd drive type 1 or 2 . After about three hours or so it all of a sudden worked after I selected 1 it booted finally and everything was installed ( operating system ) . The next problem was it would not restart and as soon as my computer would go off and come on again it would be a black screen going nowhere . Then I remembered update your BIOS dummy and I read all the notes and a lot of issues I had was fixed in the BIOS update including my restart problem . There was an issue also with my type of ROM drive not booting when put first in priority and that is the issue I had with trying to get it to boot to install my operating system . Now everything runs perfect and I could not be happier . The reason I put all this in my review was it did not go as smooth as I thought it would and someone else might have problems . If you do have issues just drop me a comment and maybe I can help you out just from what I had to do . ',normal

630,276426_3_R1L1ADTIGILN56.txt,' I bought this helmet for two reasons : disguise and durability . When you \'re out there on the streets performing missions , the last thing you want is for bad guys to recognize you . Or , worse , be able to knock you out with their lazers and baseball bats . Well this helmet , surprisingly , protects me from neither of those things . I put a lot of thought into this helmet before deciding upon it . As a vigilante crime fighter , I believed in the need for a disguise . That way , criminals could n\'t find the real me in the phone book and hurt me in my house , or hurt my cat when I am not in my house ( I \'d probably be out fighting other criminals ) . I also believed that the `` missions \'\' that are part of this helmet would help me train and fight crime with more creativity . But there are no useful missions . It \'s all weird stuff about zords . I have no idea what zords are , but they are no use to me when I \'m chasing down jewel thieves or wrestling drug dealers . Maybe someday I \'ll meet one of these zords and this training will come to some use , but I doubt it . Speaking of which , I have no idea what they meant for this helmet to protect me against . It \'s just too small , for one , and there \'s no way it could withstand the blow from a lead pipe or glass bottle . My enemies often use lead pipes and glass bottles in our battles , but thankfully I \'ve never taken a hit directly to this mega helmet . For that matter , my peripheral vision is just ruined , so I \'m often running down into dark alleys while flipping the helmet off and on just to make sure I do n\'t trip over any hobos . This exposes my face for an instant , and an instant is all a criminal needs to recognize me or fire a sonic blast into my waiting face . And how do they expect me to fight crime with the shaded visor ? Crime happens mostly at night . Night , as you may know , is darker than day . I do n\'t need a shaded visor at night . What were the Power Ranger Engineers thinking when they designed this thing ? Maybe over there in power ranger land they have very bright nighttimes , but not here . No sir . Then there are the sound effects . Look , guys , I \'m guessing that over there in power ranger land criminals are easily shocked and awed when you come at them with all kinds of futuristic sounds . But over here , they just laugh at me . Maybe that \'s the point . I do n\'t know , but at least I can kick them when they are laughing . Now here \'s something else that \'s concerning : On the box there \'s some small child in what appears to be fighting stance 16B . It also says that this mission helmet is good for 4 years and older . I assume they really mean `` 4+ years of street-level crime-fighting experience \'\' , not someone \'s literal age . Notably this `` child \'\' or `` small man \'\' on the cover is wearing no other protection and is comically trying to fight crime with only his bare hands ( in fighting stance 16B , no less ! That \'s only good for battling frogmen ! ) . I \'m an adult crime fighter and I wear shin guards at least , and also a very thick sweater if it \'s cold . Bare hands ? Only if you \'ve had bioenhancements , such as adamantium reinforcements ! If that was true , then why would this child need the protection of a helmet ? It just does n\'t make sense at all . This is just misrepresentation . For that matter , why is this in the `` toy \'\' section ? Fighting crime is a serious matter , for serious people . Even if you have no intention of using this helmet in your crime-fighting adventures , there \'s a danger of being seen as a crime-fighter by criminals simply for wearing the mission helmet .

754,48_5_R21A9WHOH6GAWU.txt,' Two design flaws render this otherwise fine remote too frustrating to use for controlling Blu-ray ( and DVD ) movies . 1 . No backlight or glowing keys , so operation in the dark is difficult . This would n\'t be a big issue if the buttons were better laid out and had some clues by touch to clarify their functions . But this is a big issue because of flaw # 2 ... 2 . The giant Stop button is positioned between the Play and Pause buttons , and all three are the same large size and shape . It \'s also between the Skip Back and Skip Forward buttons , horizontally , putting it right in the middle of all the most-used buttons . It takes an impressive level of ineptitude to design a remote like this . Years of R & D on DVD remotes have wisely made Stop buttons smaller than other buttons , and placed them out of the way . Sony seems to have ignored that wisdom . It \'s much too easy to inadvertently tap the PS3 remote \'s large , centrally positioned stop button . And unlike most DVD players , the PS3 has no `` Are you sure you want to stop the disc ? \'\' warning , for when you do . So when you accidentally stop your movie ( which you will ) , it \'s a long and irritating process to find your place again on a Blu-ray disc . It can take 5 minutes , depending on how many notices , previews , commercials and animated menus you have to get through again ( some of which you ca n\'t skip past ) . And then you have to find where you were , risking seeing images or chapter titles that give away things you really did n\'t want to know yet . All this wasted time can kill the flow of a movie . Hopefully there \'s a better remote that works with the PS3 ... one that was designed by people who test their products in real-world circumstances . ',ironisch
