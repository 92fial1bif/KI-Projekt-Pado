647,51_7_R2B5XGBGXNFED8.txt,' There seems to be a lack of reviews online for the new Sony 560 and Panasonic 80 Blu-ray players . So I purchased both of these Blu-ray players from Amazon , mainly becuase I wanted to do a critical , side by side comparison of all features and the audio and video quality . It was n\'t a professional test-based comparison , just flipping back and forth between these players and my Samsung BD-UP5000 Blu-ray/HD DVD player on my Sony 52 \'\' Bravia LCD and studying the image with a critical eye . ( I got 3 copies of the Braveheart Blu-ray to do this ) . Here \'s what I discovered : Video Quality : Pretty much a dead tie . Both players had rich , dark blacks . Video noise ( smoothness ) of the pictures was so close that I could n\'t tell which I was watching most of the time . Sharpness was the same . Both pictures had good `` 3D pop \'\' . I would n\'t be surprised if both players used the same chipset . ( By the way , the Samsung uses the Reon HQV chip , and while it looked a bit `` smoother \'\' by comparison , a tiny bit of the sharpness and detail shown on the Sony and Panasonic was missing on the Samsung . Also the Samsung has a very slight cyan cast to the blacks and the overall picture . ) Audio Quality : I think the Panasonic wins here , but only by a slim margin . Panasonic touts this player as a `` high clarity audio \'\' Blu-ray player and it does sound sweet through my Onkyo TS-SR805 receiver , on my Paradigm Monitor 11 speakers . Again , this conclusion is based only on the DolbyHD sountrack on the Braveheart Blu-ray . I \'m going to do more serious listening , but I think the Panasonic will still prove better , audio-wise , with any source material . Audio Formats : Both of these players will Bitstream or PCM output the new HD audio formats . This means that if your receiver does n\'t decode them , the player will . Or vice-versa . Some people say pre-amps/receivers do a better job at decoding than BD players do , but I guess that depends on your gear . The Panasonic DMP-BD80 sure sounds good , and I could n\'t hear a decoding difference between it or my receiver . With the Sony , I think the receiver may have sounded a touch better , but that might have been in my head . Speed and Handling : No question about it , the Sony beats the Panasonic hands down . This new Panasonic is no faster than last year \'s model it replaced , the 55 . Everything about the Panasonic is slow ... load times , react times when buttons are pressed , or when skipping chapters . The Sony 560 is about the same as the PS3 . Every cloud has a silver lining , and the Panasonic DOES give you time to make a cup of tea while your disc is loading ! Another little thing about the Panasonic that I do n\'t like is the size ( width ) of the disc tray ... it \'s the same size or a hair bigger than the disc itself ( instead of being smaller like most players ) so it \'s very hard to grab the disc . This sounds like a little niggle , but try it and see . It will drive you nuts every time you try to remove a disc ... you \'ll end up dropping them back onto the tray if you \'re not extremely careful . Remote Controls : They \'re about the same ... both very flimsy and cheaply made . Put a gun to my head and I \'ll say the Panasonic \'s remote is a little heavier and has larger buttons that are a little better laid out . The Sony 560 is drawing fire for this because it does n\'t have an eject/drawer open button on the remote . This is a silly complaint ... correct me if I \'m wrong , but you almost have to be standing in front of the player to put a disc in or take a disc out anyway , right ? ! ? ! ? ! So what \'s the big deal about having to press the `` open \'\' button on the player ? Serious remote-picky people have a Harmony remote anyway . Other Convenience Features : Neither of these players has Netflix built in , I guess that \'s a big deal now . Unless they can steam full-quality 1080P ( without pauses , subject to my ISP speed ) I could care less about that . The reason I have 3 Blu-ray players is because I care about quality and I \'m not too cheap to buy Blu-ray movies ! The Panasonic has the Amazon/VieraCast and YouTube feature though . Again , I have no desire to see a rough , low-quality mpeg video shot by an idiot on a cell phone on my high def TV ! Both of these players are BD 2.0 ( BD Live ) capable , but only the Sony has Wi-Fi built in . That \'s a nice feature because you do n\'t have to run a CAT-5 cable from your router to your Blu-ray player . I think the 560 is the first stand alone BD player to have this ( the PS3 had it all along ) . The Panasonic has 7.1 channel analog ( RCA ) audio outputs , important to people that have older receivers without HDMI . The Sony 560 dropped this feature that used to be on last year \'s 550 model . Most people have newer , HDMI capable receivers , so I see why they did it . ( Sony also did it to make their step-up model , the BDPS1000ES seem more attractive . ( That player is $ 699 and is basically a 560 with a handful of extra features added , like a headphone jack ) . The Panasonic has an SD card slot on the front , good if you want to view your pictures on your TV , and a USB jack . The Sony features two USB jacks , one on the front and one on the back . Build Quality : About the same , maybe the Sony wins here by a hair . Both are smallish players , not very deep . The Sony is about 8/10 \'s of an inch taller . Conclusion : Overall I like the Sony better . It \'s wireless connectivity is a great feature , and Sony has a great history ( with the PS3 ) of keeping the firmware updated , and this makes it easier . The Panasonic is a nice player , and has slightly better sound , but I \'m sticking with the Sony . Anyone wan na buy a slightly used Panasonic DMP-BD80 ? ( By the way ... I had no audio problems whatsoever with the Sony , like some other reviewers had . The Sony has a lot of audio output settings , and I still think some of them had them set wrong . That , or their other gear could n\'t handle the output from the 560 . I \'m seeing a bunch of posts online recently about different TV \'s and receivers not being compatible or being able to handle certain audio signals , especially bitstream ... if your gear doing the decoding does n\'t have the `` oomph \'\' or processing power to decode it , it will choke and puke ! ) ',normal

1055,16_16_R1G3PE5U7IONXK.txt,' I took my neighbor \'s kid to see this a while back . This movie pretty much ruined my night , and I will tell you how . We went to the theatre on a Friday night while I was baby-sitting ( he was like 4 years old at the time by the way ) . It was a little warm out so I stopped and got us each a Big Gulp . That was my first mistake . This kid drank an entire Big Gulp of Mountain-Dew on the way to the theater ( which I later realized contains a very high level of caffiene which he is not allowed to have ) . He said he did n\'t have to go to the bathroom before the movie , so I guess you can see where this is going . The theater itself was absolutely freezing , and this kid complained about it the entire time . The movie was a little boring and looked really fake . You could tell it was n\'t real and was just a bunch of silly-puppets , but he was only 4 so I guess he bought it ( I hope he does n\'t really think fish can talk ) . Bla Bla Bla , the fish gets lost or whatever , lots of talking , then BAM ! Shark Attack , and the kid screams and immediately proceeds to dive under the chairs , and come back up with his pants soaking wet . Great , kid . You said you didnt \' have to go BEFORE the movie , so now you decide to go DURING the movie . Later on the movie whipped this kid up into a caffiene frenzy , and he takes off his wind-breaker and starts whipping it around his head , and it hit this kid behind us and the zipper tagged him in the ear . The other kid \'s mom gave me a dirty look , so I tried to explain that my neighbor \'s kid was n\'t very smart because he is only 4 , but then I did n\'t want to start an argument so I held back my tongue . The worst part actually came when the movie was finally over and we went out to eat at McDonalds . I thought it would be cute to order the kid a fish sandwich since we just saw a movie about fishes . He took a couple of bites and asked why it tasted so bad , so I simply told him what it was . So then the kid , no joke , starts throwing-up all of his fries , and what I guess was a whole lot of mountain dew all over the chair and the floor . Then he gets seriously mad at me and does the now-vomit-covered-windbreaker frenzy . He was mad because he thought I was trying to get him to eat one of the fishes in the movie or whatever . He refused to clean it up or eat the rest of his sandwich so I just took him home . We tried to have a discussion about the difference between his sandwich in the movie , but he simply said `` I hate you \'\' ( great argument , kid ) . In conclusion I would NOT reccomend this movie due to my awful experience with this bratty kid . Also , as I mentioned earlier it looks kind of fake . Later . howardtuttleman.com ',ironisch

The author had no particularly important administrative role to the Clinton foreign or military policy development other than tagging along with the president , but he seems to consider this chore as making him as knowledgeable as Kissinger , Dulles , or Gen.

101,29_1_R3ABC7J9GJJEKZ.txt,' This book is quite simply a comic masterpiece , a novel brimming with original characters , absurd situations , and at its heart a blustery , vulnerable mama \'s boy named Ignatius J. Reilly . He is one of the most startlingly original characters in modern fiction , and his efforts at hitting the job market after his mother smashes their car will leave you in stitches . A word on the history of the novel is worth mentioning here . The author , John Kennedy Toole , committed suicide in 1969 , and his mother found the hand-written manuscript in her son \'s papers . She brought them to a publisher , who dreaded having to read even a portion of the work and to notify Toole \'s mother that it stunk . Instead , he was blown away by Toole \'s draft , and the rest is history . The novel earned him a posthumous Pulitzer Prize , and it is universally hailed by critics . Trying to summarize the plot is impossible - the book can not really be categorized . Ignatius is an over-educated oaf who stays home filling his writing tablets full of his offbeat musings on ancient history , which he plans to organize and publish some day but which presently reside all over his bedroom floor . Rome was n\'t built in a day he reminds himself . He cites in footnotes , as authority for some of his offbeat opinions , papers he had previously written and hand-delivered to the local university library for inclusion into their archives . He watches dreadful tv shows and movies , howling at the screen with a mixture of delight and loathing at the teenybopper drivel , and in the privacy of his room his self-gratification is performed while imagining visions of the old family dog . And wait til you see him out in public , getting a series of odd jobs , including a filing clerk at Levy Pants ( with very innovative filing techniques to avoid crowded file space ) as well as a costumed hot dog vendor wandering around the French Quarter in a pirate costume . All the while he begins work on his latest opus , The Journal of the Working Boy . There is a latent sadness to the plot , for while you are laughing out loud at Ignatius , his bowling-addicted mother , and the motley crew of skillfully drawn supporting characters , you sense that he will never really belong anywhere , and that he realizes his outcast status with his innate intelligence . Perhaps the author felt the same way in 1969 , leading to his own suicide . However , at least Toole did leave us A Confederacy of Dunces , a novel which reveals more with each rereading . Keep it on your shelf , and every now and then pick up the book to any page and marvel at the absurdity of Ignatius \'s grandiose ramblings , read exerpts of his bizarre historical writings , and revisit his comic efforts to organize a worker \'s revolt at Levy Pants . The list goes on and on . There is no work of litereature like it I know , and my only regret in reading Toole is the sorrow felt in knowing the tremendous body of work that was lost when he ended his life . ',normal

781,43_16_R2P6Y0EN2TITW8.txt,' When Reno the Dog \'s cop companion , Lou Swanson ( Carmine Caridi ) , is killed by a \'white supremacist \' group of terrorists , he gets teamed up with tough cop Jake Wilder ( Chuck Norris ) to bring the bad guys down . As you may have noticed , my movie summary for `` Top Dog \'\' was done in one whole sentence . That \'s because the story itself is quite simple for all audiences . It \'s the classic formula : good guys vs. bad guys . There are no ` in-betweens \' or ` switching \' of the good and bad so it \'s easy to keep track of who-is-who . Unfortunately , though the classic formula ` good vs. bad \' most often works well , `` Top Dog \'\' had more ` bad moviemaking \' going for it than any ` good moviemaking \' to make this movie worth watching . Of course , it IS entertaining , but how far will one go to be ` just \' entertained ? Chuck Norris , never really being known for his acting abilities , seems at times to be enjoying himself but on the whole , he just lets everything flow on its own . Not once does he try to make his character his own , unique one . But that could be because the director does not really give him a chance to really do anything . Instead , the audience is made to suffer somewhat by having to endure a bigger version of ` Benji \' for the hero of the film . There were mixed reviews on Amazon as to whether they liked Reno or not but in my opinion , Reno just did not impress . While , no doubt about it , we are continually made to believe that Reno is very intelligent ( and sometimes he IS ) , there are times where he \'s just annoying . The ending was too contrived and moments where Reno is supposed to be cute just does n\'t come out well . To sum up , everything Reno does is nothing special . If you \'ve seen other ` dog \' movies like `` K-19 \'\' or `` Turner and Hooch \'\' , there is nothing in `` Top Dog \'\' which you have n\'t seen before . The music was also badly done , especially the scene where the terrorists are trying to take out Chuck Norris at his house . The whole scene is supposed to be exciting , but the music utterly throws all suspense out . And ... the terrorists are wearing clown masks ? ! ? ! Ultimately , I believe that the main thing that went wrong with `` Top Dog \'\' is that the filmmakers could n\'t quite make up their minds whether to make this a movie for children or for adults . While rated PG-13 , the movie seems to be aimed for a younger audiences with having Reno the Dog as a main character . But at the same time , having terrorists and some violence would have children turning away , especially the murder of Lou Swanson . Adults however will probably be repelled from the storyline and the fact of having Reno the Dog in the story . So , in conclusion , `` Top Dog \'\' can hardly be considered a classic so I really wo n\'t put this on my ` recommend to others \' list . My advice , if you still want to watch the movie , probably better to rent than actually buy it . Trust me , it \'s not worth it . The only thing that might interest viewers is watching Chuck Norris ` do his thing \' , or shall we say , using his fighting skills . But definitely not top-notch stuff compared to other kung fu movies . ',normal

703,276425_8_R1M00P4LX428ET.txt,' I got these socks as a gift . As it was , the gift was unexpected and strange . See , I had n\'t ordered anything from Amazon and yet , when I got home , there was an Amazon box on my porch , addressed to me , yet oddly missing the normal gibberish stickers that come from the UPS or FedEx . In it was 6 pairs of socks -- these socks . `` Well , I can use some socks , \'\' I thought . So I took the socks and placed them , still wrapped , into my sock drawer . The next day , I was dressing and opened my sock drawer and found these new socks neatly folded and lined-up , which was odd . I also swear that I heard a faint rainstick and some distant tribal drumming as the drawer slid open . I attempted to wear other socks , however , mostly because I did n\'t want to wear white socks with my black shoes . But as I put the other socks on , they were all were somehow too tiny to fit onto my feet . Five times in a row this happened . I thought that I had shrunk everything in the dryer , so I gave up and put on these new Hanes cushioned crews . Immediately , I felt a sense of joy . It was strange , like the first time you kiss someone , or how you felt as a kid when waking up on Christmas morning . I kept wondering if it was the socks that made me feel that way , or if I was just somehow subconsciously triggered to reminisce . That day , in it \'s entirety , was wonderful . At least 50 people I had never spoken to before somehow knew my name . These were people on the street , even . At the coffee shop , the girl who normally had the demeanor of a disgruntled , middle-age cafeteria worker actually gave me free coffee and tried to flirt with me . Not just to flirt , but a stumbly sort of flirting that only comes about when desire has made you lose your grasp of language structure . At the university , I was excused from an upcoming midterm for a reason I do n\'t even remember . I think it involved being `` an attentive enough listener at lectures . \'\' At work , I was promoted to full-time salaried work with a bonus . However , in the parking lot , I thought my luck had turned on me as I discovered my car had been totaled by some rich guy in a Jaguar . But , no ! The guy throws me into a taxi and has me pick out a new car for myself on the nearby auto row . So within 30 minutes I was the proud owner of a new Mercedes . These socks were great that first day , and I went to bed a happy but confused man . But very soon my luck had changed . The second day I again went to put on some socks and I immediately reached for a pair of these Hanes Classics . However , they ripped in the toes and heels . Five times in a row this happened until I was plumb out of new socks . In short , Hanes makes a fantastically magical sock , but I \'m rating this sock a 2 because the quality is pretty lousy .

533,1_9_R5NG1J6G573IQ.txt,' I purchased this player to replace a Samsung BD-P2500 that was giving me major compatibility problems with Blu-ray discs , and so far have n\'t been disappointed . Picture quality on Blu-ray is stunning and I \'ve had no compatibility issues thus far ; upscaling on standard DVDs is great . VieraCast is a novel feature that could someday find greatness if Panasonic expanded support to include Amazon , Netflix and Hulu . ( I understand Amazon support is on the way . ) I have not experienced the freezing issues that some describe here , but I think that \'s due to how I use the player more than anything else . ( I watch a disc or two at a time , then power the unit off between uses - for a technical explanation of why this apparently sidesteps the problem , see the next paragraph . ) In any case , I \'ve read online recently that Panasonic has finally figured out the cause of the freezing issue and is now working on a firmware update to fix it . ( For you techies out there , here \'s a bit more detailed explanation of the freezing issue , based on what I \'ve gleaned online : Blu ray discs make heavy use of Java , and the BD60 apparently has `` garbage collection issues \'\' that cause the freezing . Powering the unit off periodically clears out what \'s in memory , minimizing the likelihood of another freeze-up . Since I tend to watch one or two Blu-Ray discs at a time and then shut the unit off for between uses , I have n\'t experienced any freezes . ) The only other quirk I can report is that while the unit does support 24fps playback on DVDs , you have to switch it on manually every time . Kind of a pain , but only a pain if you \'re a video purist . That \'s it . No other issues .

I \'d buy a brand new one at this price in a heartbeat . These are made by Samick , who purchased the Silvertone name to directly sell their guitars in America instead of just building guitars for other manufacturers . The Epiphone SG Custom was manufactured by Samick for Epiphone/Gibson for a while . I saw one with exactly the same inspection sticker as my yard-sale Silvertone ! My unit is fairly beat up , but some touch up with a black Sharpie prettied it up quite a bit . I suspect that the switch was broken when the guitar did a face plant at some point .

1073,12_15_R310M7IQBIW069.txt,' We have had this in our house for a week , and I must say that there are many features in this that improve over the earlier LEGO games by this company . My son ( 11 ) and daughter ( 15 ) , whom I have watched with his friends rather than played myself ( on a new flatscreen TV , which admittedly adds to their excitement ) , are utterly mesmerized by the world and narrative that they are able to enter with this game . When I bought it ( in Europe at about 1/3 more in price ) , I was worried that it would only be a simple variation on the earlier LEGO video games . To summarize , the earlier games ( Star Wars , Indiana Jones , Batman , all of which we have in more than one format ) allow children to become part of the story . They know the films , but are able to interact in the environment and create their own versions . These are not games with an adversary to beat or at least compete against , but a collaborative journey where you try to get through a number of obstacles , more similar to a maze than , say , monopoly . This is a wonderful variation for kids , who too often seek enemies in video games or someone to conquer . In the LEGO tradition , there is also a building motif , where you collect enough parts to get to a kind of construction critical mass , so you win a level and objects are assembled and a film episode is played with LEGO characters . It has action , but is not bloodily violent , so good for little kids . Finally , it is easy to start over and keep going on a journey through the films . Just this makes these unique game concepts , but you can only get so many . There is absolutely wonderful detail and characters in a simplified LEGO version that is charming , though they do n\'t talk . While this is definitely in continuity with the earlier games and so reassuringly familiar as all great brands should be , I was happily impressed with this version , which I think is a quantum improvement . The environment is more complex and multi-facetted , with all of the HPotter universe to explore . The levels and tasks they have to perform are more complex than the earlier games , so it is longer lasting , and there appears to me to be more character in the powers and personalities of each figure that my kids can choose to play . There is absolutely nothing that seems derivative about this . For example , instead of hitting , whipping , or cutting with a light saber , they can cast spells that are far more varied in their effects . As a school , there are also lessons to learn at each stage , which adds a new dimension that relates to the narrative . Warmly recommended . This is a wonderful addition to an evolving medium .

I wanted another watch that was less dressy , and was happy when I found this watch at a low price . However , this watch looks very nice , despite its price . Some reviewers do n\'t like the watchband . I agree that a leather band would make it look more expensive , but this is a military watch and the band is quite appropriate . Although the description calls this a canvas strap , the inside is coated so that it does not absorb sweat . Also , I have small wrists and Eco-Drives are the only watches that I can wear without modifying the strap . It \'s VERY easy to set .

1210,34_8_R2IJ3EJOCJDUDQ.txt,' But if not , you \'ll be bored silly by this book . I know I was . I \'ve rarely stopped reading a book before reaching the end , but I was sooo close with this one . The only reason I kept reading was because of all the 5 star ratings I saw here . I thought , surely , it must get better . It has to ! I was waiting for all the \'laugh out loud \' moments that everyone was talking about but they never appeared . My advice : if you \'re not laughing away midway through , abandon ship ! It does n\'t get any better . In fact it gets worse . To be honest , I tend to read more serious stuff . I \'ve read a couple really great \'chick lit \' books but this one really falls short . I picked it up at the library in search of a quick light read . I did n\'t find it such a quick read because I just could n\'t get into it . And yes , it \'s light but really dull and well , for me anyway , boring . Where do I start with what I disliked about this book ? The characters are flimsy caricatures -- completely unbelievable and they \'re all so irritatingly thick . The dialogue never really goes anywhere . Emma has this completely irritating habit of starting every other sentence with `` er , uh , um .... \'\' Whatever laughs there are are so belaboured that they \'re just not funny anymore . For instance , the big scene where Jack spews all of Emma \'s secrets & her colleagues respond in shock to every single darned one goes on for some 4 pages ( \'You \'re really a size 6 ? \' \'You have a Barbie bedspread ? \' \'You hate crochet ? \' bla bla bla ... ) Boy , funny stuff . You already know what all of them are anyway , so there \'s just no sense of suspense or tension . And in general , you know what \'s going to happen ages before it does , so as I was reading I kept thinking \'oh come on , get on with it already ! \' I found the writing style just plain flat and uninspiring . There \'s just no depth of any kind . Worst of all , the plot line is so contrived . I completely get why Emma would think she was \'madly \' in love with Jack after just a couple dates but what \'s Jack \'s deal ? Are we really supposed to believe that some multi-millionaire CEO would fall in love with this ditzy , dim junior employee who is easily what , 20 years his junior ? Riiiight .

The Other Side of the Story by Marian Keyes is an incredibly witty , smart , sparkly , genuine laugh-out-loud book .

208,49_2_R3K5ZH61DYQ5L3.txt,' While this is still a very good show , it \'s already come dangerously close to jumping the shark ( jumping the Sook ? ) , in just it \'s second season . I wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars but that \'s not possible here . I just could n\'t bring myself to give it four , so I went with three . For starters , the show has veered much too far off on a tangent concerning the Maenad Maryann , and many , many viewers have been frustrated by it . Too little time was spent on the vampires of Dallas , which I found to be far more interesting . Too much attention was also spent on the Jason/Fellowship of the Sun arc , which was a deviation from the book series . All in all , there was too much `` filler \'\' to get to the good stuff . The penultimate episode ( # 11 , `` Frenzy \'\' ) was a disconcerted illogical mess with few highlights , and the portrayal of the vampire Queen of Louisiana , despite Evan Rachel Ward \'s beauty , left much to be desired , for whatever reasons . I think Holly Valance , who played `` Lola \'\' in the ( now regrettably defunct ) Moonlight episode `` B.C \'\' would \'ve worked out better . `` Frenzy \'\' is widely regarded as by far the worst episode of the series so far , for various reasons . Still , inevitably , many characters have been been interestingly further fleshed out from the first season , adding depth to the series ; notably , Eric , Pam , Sam , Jason , Tara and her mother , but mostly the effervescent Lafayette , played by the very talented Nelsan Ellis . While many deviations from the books have been made , some good , some bad , the decision to keep the character of Lafayette alive was definitely a good move . We also get to see , briefly , the darker , more powerful side of Eric . Anna Paquin is playing the role she was born to play , she just shines in her role as Sookie , and all in all , the cast is amazing , despite some lapses in judgement this year from the writing staff .

163,40_6_RK7UVOC6XO84N.txt,' I have been using this phone for about a week now . And while this device beats previous bold 9000 in many aspects there is still much to be improved . So let me first say things that I do like about the phone . Of course the greatest improvement was the addition of the trackpad , at first it was kind of unusual to navigate with it but I got accustomed to it very quickly . Second thing is the screen resolution , it was improved from the old bold by 480x360 vs 480x320 pixels . The screen is really crisp and bright and sunlight legibility is very decent . The camera also experienced an improvement and while I was taking pictures outside on a bright day and later comparing them to the previous bold , there is a very noticeable change , pictures look somewhat close to my wife \'s 10 megapixel canon camera . I was also surprised by the improved quality of the videos this device shoots . Much better and less pixelated than the original bold ! Now for the things that I do n\'t like or wished to be improved . Despite of the fact that everyone raves about `` amazing \'\' battery life on this device , I must say I am disappointed . At best , the battery lasts me a day and a half but not two day as many reviewers say . Perhaps I do extensive web browsing and chatting via instant messaging . I usually like to read various blogs and news on opera mini 5 browser and I noticed that this application along with IM+ drains battery like crazy ! Of course at least now I do n\'t have to carry a spare battery with me like it was with the previous bold since I am sure this one will last me for the full day . But most often I still have to charge it every night . Which is kind of a disappointment and not what I expected after reading various reviews . Now about the browser : It sucks .... It simply sucks so much that any other smartphone \'s browser will put it to shame . But another annoying problem now that I noticed is that I ca n\'t get to mobile version of citibank online at all ! No matter how I would reconfigure the browser ... So it means no banking online for me as I used to do on my previous bold . Very annoying ... The browser is still slow as hell and only the fact that I have opera on this phone does n\'t make it a deal breaker . I must say though that I am running a latest .405 version of the software and perhaps the issue with banking online maybe be fixed in later versions . Which I again , doubt very much . Now another disappointment is the absence of many supported languages . For example there is no Russian support whatsoever . But than again , it may be released in the later versions . I hope so . And now last but not least is the speaker quality . In the first day of use I noticed that the speaker has been downgraded . Instead of the three speakers which previous bold had , this device has only one and when you bring the volume all the way up you can hear a rattling noise . Not a very nice experience ... Overall I like the device especially it \'s size , I was skeptical about it as I liked the bold 9000 big screen . But this one seems to be slim and looks more eye appealing . also I like the battery cover design , you can not accidentally open it and whole device seems sturdy and has a look of a professional tool . Hopefully with next updates there will be support for more languages . But as of now I am giving it only 3 stars . UPDATE : Couple of weeks ago I noticed that phone would randomly delete data , but today was the worst : In the morning I discovered that all my contacts were completely wiped out ! ! ! by itself ! And when I tried to restore them from the backup file it would not do that saying that the file is read only . I tried this file in my old curve 8310 and it worked flawlessly . So I suspect that there are serious bugs in the OS 5.0 and AT & T is not coming up with any updates as of yet . In a mean time I am lowering score for this phone because i am very disappointed by the poor implementation UPDATE 2 : As five months passed since I got this phone , I must admit I like it much more than I did before . True , I still have some issues with it , but these issues are just too minor comparing to lots of useful features that this device delivers . Previously I wrote that it deleted all my contacts from the phone book , and last week it just happened again but I noticed that it happened after I added an another gmail account to the phone . So after I gooogled a bit I found out that gmail actually will sync your contacts with your gmail account but for some unknown reason remove them from the phone book . So basically all you have to do is to download google sync on your phone and transfer contacts back to the phone book . So I tend to believe that this issue has more to do with google gmail setup rather than the phone itself . Also the issue with the Citibank mobile site have resolved mysteriously , and now I am able to do banking through the native browser ( which still sucks by the way in many aspects ) I am also looking forward to the release of OS 6.0 which should include webkit browser with flash support and other new and exciting features . So I must say that ever since I got this phone it never crashed or restarted on me , not even a single time . So I must increase the rating of the phone to 4 stars as it \'s been a really great tool which I certainly can rely on in terms of usability and trust . ',normal
1205,13_9_R1YPFGQ15RJ8HX.txt,' I have been a major Sookie Stackhouse fan for years . I began reading Charlaine Harris \'s series , then called the Southern Vampire Mysteries , since before book four came out , and have read them all in order . I was puzzled when I found out that HBO was going to make a TV adaptation of it . Why this particular series ? Why not Laurell K. Hamilton \'s Anita Blake series ? ( It would have been suitable , what with all of the sex and all . ) There were others as well , like Kelley Armstrong \'s Women of the Otherworld and MaryJanice Davidson \'s Queen Betsy series -- all of which have the erotic tones that HBO would have loved . So why this book series ? Now I know why , but more on that later . I very much enjoyed season one . It was very faithful to Dead Until Dark , except that small characters like Tara and Lafayette were expanded , and you get everyone \'s point of view , not just Sookie \'s . Also , Bill has more depth here , and you see things from his point of view , and you understand him better . Other storylines were added , like the emphasis on `` V \'\' addiction , which makes sense . Season two has taken things to a whole other level and I love it so far . I ca n\'t wait for the blu-ray release ! From the very beginning , the show has very sexually explicit scenes , most of which centered on Jason \'s exploits , and some violence as well , with a great deal of emphasis to vampire hatred as the new form of southern racism/segregation . Season two takes things further , with gore and horror replacing the sex ( there \'s still plenty of it though ) , and the fledging out of characters like Eric , Tara and Lafayette ( whose death does not happen in the TV series ) . MaryAnn is the mysterious creature that makes a brief appearance in Living Dead in Dallas , but is expanded on the TV version to the point that she almost takes over the entire show . Jessica , Bill \'s `` daughter , \'\' puzzled me at first . What \'s the purpose to this character ? But I like her now , especially after Hoyt becomes her love interest . And I love the emphasis on vampire makers , like Lorena and Godric , the latter of whom moved me almost to tears in the last episode that he \'s in ( plus , the actor who plays him is totally hot ) . I do n\'t want to ruin it for people who do n\'t have HBO and have to wait for the DVD or blu-ray release , but , in spite of the departures from the books , it \'s better than season one . The actors are great . Ann Paquin has grown on me as Sookie , British hottie Stephen Moyer is wonderful as Bill , and I finally like Alexander Skarsgard as everyone \'s favorite vampire bad boy Eric . I am also enjoying Sam Trammel ( Sam Merlotte ) , Rutina Wesley ( Tara ) , Nelsan Ellis ( Lafayette ) , Michelle Forbes ( MaryAnn Forester ) and Ryan Kwatten ( Jason Stackhouse ) . I am also enjoying the actors who play Andy Belleflour and Hoyt for the comic relief they supply . ( Andy is hilarious as the drunken out-of-work cop who witnesses the orgies and general odd behavior and no one believes him . ) All in all , if you \'re a big fan of the books , then you wo n\'t want to miss this show . No boring moments throughout the hour-long series . I can not wait for season three and season two is not even over yet ! And I see why HBO decided to adapt this particular book series . They must \'ve seen the potential for character development and the southern setting on the small screen . Great job ! ',normal

THere are 3 kinds of grenades , which is unnecessary and just harder to switch between . You can also only carry 2 of each instead of 4 . Since the new grenades stick like the plasmas , they do n\'t add much and just add another layer of choice and button-pushing . Too complicated . Also , the little bonus things like flares and landmines are gimmicky and add too much comlpication . Again , advanced gamers probably love it , but I \'m too old to learn all this new stuff . Just give me a gun and some grenades . In previous games you \'d come across more types of things to do , like a lot of sniper rifles so you could sit on a hilltop picking off aliens or use other strategy . In this game you do n\'t find a lot of useful weapons , so there \'s a lot more direct hand to hand , on the ground type combat . I \'ve also found that it \'s easier to kill things and easier in general to solve the levels . Also , it uses the `` follow me \'\' arrow and the voice gives you suggestions if you seem to be missing the point , which I like , since in previous Halos I \'ve spent hours wandering around wondering what I \'m supposed to be doing . No such problems here . They \'ve sufficiently dumbed it down . I \'ve had a few graphic glitches in this one , which has never happened before . I \'ve also gotten stuck and unable to get out of things twice . THe sound and graphics are great , of course . I \'ve never paid any attention to the story , unless it required me to , so I ca n\'t comment on that . Kusdos to Bungie for making it easy to skip over . Overall , this is the same experience as the others , though it seems easier than Halo2 . As little thought as that required , this one requires less . I \'ve not had to think at all about weapon choice , strategy , or anything , Just pull the trigger and kill ! I wish there were more FPS games like this -- fast-paced , completely intuitive hand controls , easy storyline , simple mission , and FUN . ',normal

209,33_12_RU0BR91PJ2DG7.txt,' I \'ve had an opportunity to use Office 2010 Beta edition for a couple of months now and now that I see the full , final , edition I can say that this is a very worthwhile upgrade . First things first , I am not a techie . I am someone who uses Word , Excel and PowerPoint on a very regular basis , who really liked some of the changes in Office 2007 but who thought some things needed tweaking , so when given the opportunity for the beta edition I jumped on it and have not been disappointed . Office 2010 is to Office 2007 what Windows 7 was to Vista ; that is , there are not many breakthrough , drastically different features , but a whole lot of polishing and cleanup to make it easier and more efficient . Overall , the program seems to run faster , incorporates many of the most commonly used options and makes them more accessible ( eliminating many dialog boxes and tabs ) and allows for more customization . At first glance it looks very much like its predecessor , the ribbon is back and it is now also found on OneNote . There are plenty of sites that will give you a play-by-play on all the features available in this new version , so I \'m just going to mention some of the biggest improvements that I \'ve seen . 1 ) The biggest change is the addition of the web apps . It may not be a true direct competitor to google docs , but it allows for easier sharing of documents , as well as making your documents more accessible . 2 ) The ribbon is back and it now includes the `` File \'\' option and a new feature called `` Backstage view . \'\' Backstage view incorporates the most commonly used actions in one place ( yay ! no more dialog boxes with tabs ) . You get the usual open , save and print , but you also get several templates for new documents , print layouts and ways to share your work , all without dialog boxes and tabs , everything is much more easily accessible . 3 ) Another new feature is that the ribbon is now customizable so you can organize it according to your needs . 4 ) There is a Paste Preview which lets you switch between paste options so you can make sure that your work will be formatted correctly . Changes in PowerPoint . You can now edit video directly on PowerPoint . You can trim a video , add effects , fades and even triggers for animations for the presentation . Another new feature is that you can add effects and edit images without the need for third party software . Changes in Word . One nifty new feature in Word is called `` Navigation pane , \'\' which replaces the old document map . It incorporates minor changes in design that make big changes in productivity and ease of use . It allows you to quickly rearrange the document . Take for example a document with several headings/sections . The Navigation pane provides a list of all the headings . The headings are live , so you can drag them up or down , thus rearranging the document . It also incorporates most of the functions that used to be available in the `` Find \'\' dialog box but now they are all visible so you do n\'t have to go digging through several menus to find the option that you need . Changes in Excel . Most of the changes in Excel deal with very large datasets . There is a new PowerPivot add-in which works great if you are dealing with a very large dataset that does not fit in one Excel spreadsheet . PowerPivot pulls the data from multiple sources ( several Excel spreadsheets for instance ) to analyze it . Summary : Overall this is one well planned and executed upgrade that essentially takes all the promises of Office 2007 and makes them a reality . Yes , some things are different , and it will take some getting used to ; but , once you realize the improvement in efficiency you \'ll agree that the changes are mostly for the positive . The only thing that I truly wish had changed but did n\'t is that this version does not include Outlook . That is available in the Home and Business version . ',normal

949,13_13_R387U1ZP3VQ5AL.txt,' Thank you to all my reading friends who suggested The Awakening as one of their favorite classic novels ! I have been trying to branch out into new literary worlds , and the classics is one genre that I had n\'t yet touched . Still a novice , but my journey has been so profitable thus far . The Awakening was one novel that is incredibly easy to read and holds such powerful prose in so few pages . A taboo subject back in its day , The Awakening tells the story of one woman \'s emotional journey from a stifled , miserable marriage to a spirited and lusty freedom . Young Edna Pontellier feels trapped in a loveless , although pampered , life with husband , Leonce . Stirrings of independence begin one summer while resorting in Grand Isle , an island off the coast of Louisiana . These new feelings have begun a profound change in Edna , liberating her beyond belief . Thus ensues an infidelity that dreams are made of , although at the expense of her marriage and motherhood . Hardly shocking in this day and age , The Awakening \'s subject of marital infidelity and physical lust for another is always a pageturner . The theme of the novel -- Edna \'s torment at the chains that bind her and the flutterings of an unbridled passion -- is brought to life with beautiful writing in simple , elegant words . I am surprised to find such a passionate and provocative story within its pages . Short but penetrating , The Awakening will move you . ',normal

1245,21_19_R2DRW6X3LFRVIO.txt,' The message Hollywood appears to be sending burgeoning cradle to grave twenty-something consumers in this crude , unintelligent , pathetic film is `` Go ahead ! Be irresponsible ! Show a complete and utter lack of common sense ! Have no self-respect and get pregnant out of wedlock with the next drunken rube who comes along ! Why ? Because everybody loves babies ! \'\' This film is as offensive and unsettling as movies can get . There \'s absolutely no resonance to the film .... no emotional core to help even justify the ludicrous relationship between these two characters and what transpires . The film \'s bottom line is sometimes ( often ? ) white , middle class twenty-somethings get drunk , and babies are born .... and sometimes ( almost never ? ) the egg donor and the sperm donor end up staying together against all odds and the child is subsequently raised in a loving , healthy family environment . Needless to say , the f-bombs tossed around in the movie are beyond overkill , as are the adolescent antics of the male lead and his neanderthal roommates . Simply put , it \'s a horrible film . Still , the overwhelming sucess of this movie among young adults ( I use the term `` adults \'\' loosely ) and the film \'s beyond misguided attempt at providing a `` heartwarming \'\' love story under the guise of `` comedy \'\' holds up a very real mirror to the American cultural obsession with motherhood , pregnancy and childbirth on the one hand and Hollywood \'s stop-at-nothing attitude toward harnessing the basest aspects of American youth culture in order to make a buck .

While , yes , you are not getting a blu-ray player with this system , you could expect to actually spend that $ 1000 retail price if you decided to purchase a system equal to this with a blu-ray player . As a secondary bedroom or even primary sound system , I found the quality to be superb for the price . For a sub- $ 300 2.1 system this little guy really did well competing with our larger more expensive 5.1 Yamaha system . While the Yamaha will beat this system just because 5.1 will always sound better than 2.1 , the sound from the speakers were crisper , clearer , and the subwoofer could nearly rattle the walls using it at full power . You still got the feeling of surround sound from this system . For those who are not technologically inclined , this was not difficult at all to set up .

If you \'re budget is under $ 300 and this is a second system for a smaller room or bedroom , I say go for it .

I did n\'t have a way to play it then , but I do now , so even if this review is n\'t terribly timely , I hope you \'ll find it helpful . The game takes place in the world of Albion , a beautiful , lovely world somewhere between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment . In that it quickly differentiates itself from most fantasy worlds . You play the Hero . You do n\'t get a name , but you can get titles ( like Lionheart , Executioner or the NAMBLA-friendly , Chicken Chaser ) . You can be male or female , good or evil . You can marry the opposite sex or the same sex . You can customize your looks with new hair styles , tattoos , facial hair and hair dye . You get all sorts of different clothes to pick from , and get scars when you die . You also age . In addition , you get a whole slew of skills . You can learn how to chop wood , for example . If that \'s not exciting enough , you can also tend bar ! Blacksmithing , bounty hunting and a couple other jobs round things out . If jobs are n\'t your thing , you can go on a whole series of quests , though not very many . During these quests , you can earn gold which you can use to buy all the usual stuff , plus real estate . Yes , if you want you can become the next Donald Trump ! One of my friends has done this and basically owns every bit of property that can be owned . This is an action RPG , which is different from regular RPGs in that you do n\'t select options from a menu screen . No , instead you bash , smash and crush your enemies by repeated button-mashing . Think of the Zelda games . You have both melee weapons and ranged weapons as well as a series of spells , some of which can be lots of fun ! Along the way , you have a dog acting as your faithful companion . Allegedly he helps in fights , but not so you \'d notice . What he mostly does is sniff out treasure , and that \'s a damn nice thing , given how well-hidden some of the treasure chests are .

193,25_6_RCZFUW8W9BABN.txt,' There are already some very well-written informative reviews on this player , so I \'ll try to focus on the `` out of the box experience \'\' since mine is literally just out of the box today . Because my order on Amazon for this product was backordered for a month or more , I called all the local Best Buys until I found a WD TV Live that was not showing up on their `` store availability \'\' page and purchased it for $ 119 plus tax ( oh how I missed Amazon when the tax was added on at my local store ! ) . The price on Amazon has gone all over the place the last few days , from $ 119 to $ 149 . I \'m assuming we \'ll see it at $ 99 after the initial release period is over since several media players are now priced at that point . I went home , unpacked the box and in my haste I did n\'t even see the installation CD that came with the unit . ( I just ran it now so I could tell you about it - it includes a utility which allows your computer to `` see \'\' the WD TV , as well as the manual and some other fluff ) . I plugged the WDTV into an ethernet jack on my router , used the supplied cables to attach to my TV , plugged in the power cable and literally minutes later I was watching videos stored on my computer ! The WD TV immediately logged onto our computer network and saw both of our computers ( Windows XP ) , and I was able to watch media stored on both . Wow . Very easy . Then I navigated to Pandora , punched in my account information , and 30 seconds later was listening to my Pandora music stations . Next stop was YouTube ( another menu option ) , I plugged in my YouTube name and password , and was able to see my YouTube subscriptions . I then went into the settings menu and clicked on `` update firmware \'\' just to make sure I had the latest firmware installed . After about 5 seconds of the unit checking with Western Digital , it confirmed my firmware is up to date . Again , very easy . I was also able to register the unit from the onscreen display , and received a confirmation email . I found the onscreen menus very logically laid out and easy to use . Watching movies stored on my computer and accessing YouTube/Pandora was great - but I wanted to see if I could access Hulu . So , I navigated to the `` media server \'\' menu and it saw my Tversity software program running on one computer . I clicked on that and minutes later I was watching `` Glee \'\' ( a program on ABC ) . The only issue I ran into was that fast forward would sometimes cause the program to freeze and I would need to re-start . Given that this media player is brand new and basically in what feels like a beta release , sold out just about everywhere , I \'m assuming that a firmware upgrade in the coming weeks will fix that bug as well as any others I come across . I tried a few other programs and was only able to replicate the issue intermittently . However , pause caused no problems . And , I do n\'t expect Western Digital to support Tversity , which may be the root of the problem ( vs the WD player ) so I \'m not taking off marks for that one issue . I \'m just happy I can watch a variety of shows streamed from Tversity on the WD TV . ( A google search on Tversity will take you to the download site for that wonderful free to try program ) . My previous media server , the D-Link DSM-320 D-Link DSM-320 Wireless Media Player , Audio/Photo/Video , 802.11g , is not nearly as nice ... I spent hours and hours and hours ( days ) configuring it and getting it to `` see \'\' my home network . I also found the user menus to be very cumbersome with navigation almost an afterthought . In contrast , the WD TV is a dream come true and definitely feels like the `` next generation \'\' of media servers . I \'ve tried a number of video and music formats , and they \'ve all played with no problem ( except for the fast forward issue above ) . I watched a slide show of pictures stored on one of my computers . All of this without reading a single manual or going to a single internet help forum . Literally , plug and play . So , overall , I \'d say this is a strong unit , and I \'m very happy with it . Since I am reviewing the unit much sooner than I normally would , I do commit to the Amazon community that if I experience issues with the WD TV I \'ll return to update this review . But based on my experience with other media servers and other hardware setups , I think this is a winner . Highly recommended . Hope this helps ! UPDATE 11/12/2009 : Almost a month later and I \'m 1000 \% happy with this player ... no issues . Works great ... fast .. great interface ... I \'m going to give one or two of these as holiday presents this year . I \'ve replaced my DVR on my second TV and no longer pay the cable company $ 14 per month for a DVR ... this little gizmo is going to pay for itself ! LAST UPDATE 12/5/2009 : I was experiencing video freezing with Hulu using the Tversity software on my computer ... I switched to Playon and am really glad I did ! Flawless performance on Hulu streaming and TONS of content ( i.e . you can watch tons of old TV shows like Dynasty and Mary Tyler Moore ) . Still very happy with this unit . I do agree with other reviewers - it would be nice if remote had a volume control , and some of the navigation screens are a bit `` clunky \'\' but overall very happy . ',normal

Furthermore , I concur 100 \% with the reviews of the two previous pack leaders regarding the potency of this garment when it comes to the ladies . My story is as follows ... Recently , I was invited to an 80 \'s theme party at a campus sorority house . Knowing that every frat boy d-bag with a faux hawk , tribal tattoo , and crotch rocket would come to the party dressed as Zach Morris ( big cell phone , double popped collars , white-washed denim , etc . ) I desired a chance to really set myself apart ... from the pack . Naturally , my selection to accomplish this goal had to 1 ) be wolf-related , 2 ) project a certain subtle sexuality in its theme , and 3 ) be a bold color . Boom ! Wolf Gaze . Size large . Piss yellow . Admittedly , I did cave slightly to the 80 \'s theme and rocked a pair nylon track pants and Reebok Pumps ( hey , even the ` lonest \' of wolves has to roll with the rules of the forest ) . That said , my look was achieved and a vibe was emitted . Beautiful babies dressed in poofy prom dresses were admiring my status as the alpha male all night long . One girl in particular caught my eye from a distance and the hunt was on . Her hair was frizzy , her earrings were huge , and her outfit was all shades of neon ... just my type . As I went in for the kill , it was as if the power of the Wolf Gaze took over and not only impacted her inner urges , but dictated the song selection as well . The lights dimmed , the strobes kicked on , and the sweet , sweet sounds of Duran Duran \'s `` Hungry like the Wolf \'\' filled the room . Needless to say , the night ended successfully . In conclusion : buy the Wolf Gaze , be the lone-wolf leader that you are , get chicks . If needed , Duran Duran is always available for support . ',ironisch

1133,6_8_R3L1WK2Q10GBTN.txt,' Wireless works great . Sound is decent from the size of the speakers . I did hook it up to larger front towers , and that makes it excellent ! Overall this is a great device to go along with your LG tv . One point of note , if you have this , you do not need the wireless dongle that is sold separately for the tv . All the same features are in this device , ie . Netflix , Pandora , Vudu , etc .. the only draw back without using the dongle is you have to have this turned on and the sound will need to come from it rather than the tv . Not really a big deal as you would probably want it on anyway if streaming a movie or music . It will also turn on and off automatically with the tv , as well as turning the tv on when it is turned on . Great thinking on LG \'s part .

698,33_9_R18XUZW5H9QHQX.txt,' I \'m suspecting that there are two types of people who are approaching this DVD , a filmed version of the stage production of `` Jekyll & Hyde \'\' . One , someone familiar with the show -- perhaps saw it and liked it or has the soundtrack -- and wants to check out this variation . Or two , someone discovering it anew . It tempts me to write two reviews because while I love `` Jekyll & Hyde \'\' , it \'s slightly unfortunate that this is the production most people will get a chance to judge . So let me preface this by saying that I really am a fan of this show . Some people consider `` Jekyll \'\' sort of a `` Phantom-lite \'\' . I , myself , have never been the biggest supporter of `` Phantom of the Opera \'\' . It \'s fine , full of bombast , but hardly the revolutionary experience that people give it credit for . `` Jekyll \'\' does play to similar themes , but has a stronger overall soundtrack . Instead of a couple of showstoppers like `` Phantom \'\' , `` Jekyll \'\' is filled with memorable power ballads . Not the most complicated show musically , it is very accessible . And when you have great singers , these simpler and emotionally charged songs become pop opera and quite moving . So , without hesitation , I recommend the original Broadway Cast recording ! ! ! Robert Cuccioli , Linda Eder and Christiane Noll are superb . You could n\'t hope for better . But here \'s the problem with this DVD , it \'s not this great cast -- NO , the star is David Hasselhoff . So you see my problem , do n\'t you ? Look , I \'m not going to be unkind -- it \'s an easy target . Let \'s just say this . If you \'re a fan of the show , he does n\'t completely ruin it . And it \'s not like there are any other versions to add to your collections . If you are new to the show , I \'m still recommending it provisionally . I wish there were another option . If you like the show , though -- and I think you will -- please rush over and buy the 1997 Cast recording . Treat yourself to how `` Jekyll & Hyde \'\' should really sound . KGHarris , 10/06 .

500,36_9_R1K51UN9PAUF7E.txt,' To keep it simple , To Kill a Mockingbird is more boring than watching people answer phones on PBS during pledge drives . The book \'s plot basically goes no where , and does not take any opportunities to make itself great . Instead , it takes the route of pure boredom , shallow characters , and an asinine plot that is so lame and so boring , a Lucky Charms commercial has a more compelling plot . I was barely able to keep myself awake during the time I read this book , and when I was able to stay awake , I was mostly spent that time imagining what else I could be doing with my time . God only knows how this book even is considered one of the greatest books ever , it \'s only a book of pure suckyness . WHAT IT \'S ABOUT : The time is the 1930 \'s , some years after The Great Depression . The story is told in a narrative by main character ; Scout Finch ; as she describes the racism and prejudice in her town somewhere in Alabama . Her father ; Atticus Finch ; is chosen to represent an African-American man accused of raping a girl named Violet Ewell . She talks about all of the experiences she , her brother Jem , and her father go through during this time in which racism was the norm and they receive much prejudice themselves . The main moral of the story is that if you kill a mockingbird , it \'s a sin and this book uses that moral to describe prejudice . How touching , too bad the book as a whole desecrates that moral with a horribly put together story . What ruins this book is the terrible dialogue , boring , shallow characters , a premise that goes no where , and much more .

1154,13_8_R20V0KLHMC0PQ6.txt,' For those who do n\'t know , the Panasonic G1 is the first ( of hopefully many ) camera that adheres to the new micro 4/3 format . What is so exciting about it ? All SLR cameras use mirrors , prisms , and optical viewfinders so that the photographer can see what his/her subject `` through the lens . \'\' SLRs have remained the defacto standard for most serious photographers because most find the whole viewfinder concept so appealing . The micro 4/3 does away with the mirrors and prisms , and replaces the optical viewfinder of SLRs with an electronic viewfinder . This allows the cameras that adhere to the standard to be much smaller ( and wideangle lenses designed for this mount to be smaller as well ) . Onto the real review ... The EVF on the G1 is the first that I \'ve seen that is remotely usable . While not as good as the OVF in my 5D , it is considerably better than the OVF in my older 350D . The first look through the EVF will impress anyone who has n\'t used a Full-Frame camera before . While there is a noticeable lag ( particularly when moving the camera around ... a delay of a 10th of a second maybe ) , the fact that you can see a live histogram in the VF makes the lag completely worthwhile . Even better , the VF can increase the gain of the screen in darker conditions so you can actually see what you are shooting ( it does get grainy , but it is better than seeing nothing at all ) . Finally , when you engage Manual Focus , the view in the EVF zooms in on your subject automatically which allows for perfect manual focus adjustments every time ! ! Without a doubt , this is the best interchangeable lens camera on the market if you are interested in manually focusing . The articulating LCD is another design choice that is spot-on ! ! Why have n\'t other manufacturers caught on that `` live view \'\' is completely useless without an articulating LCD ? Switching from the LCD to the EVF is as simple as putting your eye next to the viewfinder . There is a sensor there that detects when it is being used . The LCD does n\'t have the super resolution of the new 5DMkII or the D700 , but it has twice the resolution of my older 5D . So is the camera pocketable ? Not a chance . However , it is n\'t much bigger than the larger ( with its kit lens ) than modern superzoom Point & Shoot cameras . I bought it because I found that I was leaving my 5D ( with 24-70 f/2.8 ) at home more often than not because i did n\'t want to carry so much weight . The G1 , in comparison , is a joy to hold and carry . For me , the size is just right . Any smaller and the controls would be unusably small . Any larger and the camera would begin to resemble smaller DSLRs . Side Note : The kit lens has to be seen to be believed ... it is SO small . Even the 45-200 lens ( 90-400 ) is n\'t much bigger than kit lenses for APS-C or FF cameras ( let alone comparing it to the monstrous 100-400 lens that canon makes ) . Noise is reasonable . I would n\'t go past ISO1250 for prints with the G1 . ISO1600 and 3200 are more than useable for web viewing ( which is how a majority of my pics are displayed ) . I never really understood how printable ISO6400 prints are suddenly required for every camera ... how many people actually print a large number of images anyways ? Downsized to Facebook or Picasaweb sizes , I would imagine that a ISO6400 G1 image would be more than adequate . What I do n\'t like is the lack of any large aperture lenses for the format . You can buy adapters to use standard 4/3 lenses but the older 4/3 lenses are likely larger than their future micro43 counterparts ( and AF does n\'t work with many of them ) . Adapters also exist for Leica M mount ( I \'m trying to convince my fiance that leica lenses are a better investment than the stock market right now ... but I do n\'t think that she is buying it ) . The depth of field for micro43 is already larger due to the smaller sensor so it will be hard to get subject isolation in photographs until large aperture prime lenses become available . I \'m really excited about the future of this format . Panasonic has promised a G1HD someone in the first half of this year ( a G1 with video capabilities ) . In addition , 3 new lenses have been announced : a 7/14 f/4 , a 14-140 , and best of all a 20 mm f/1.7 pancake ! Olympus also showed off a concept of a micro43 camera that looked no bigger than a small point & shoot . The future is exciting ! ',normal

492,31_9_R1IZ827H39HPIR.txt,' This , friends , was the single book that so fatefully launched Ernest Hemingway \'s amazing and long-lived literary career . As such it is as close to being a legendary book as they come , yet some seventy five years after its initial publication , it still offers a story that is also surprisingly fresh , personal , and memorable . For all of his obvious excesses , Hemingway was an artist compelled to delve deliberately into painful truths , and he attempted to do so with a style of writing that cut away all of the frills and artifice , so that at it s heart this novel is meant as a exploration into what it means to be adult and alive . Thus we are introduced to Jake Barnes , a veteran of World War One , now forced by his wounds to live as a man without the ability to act like one , forced by impotence to forgo all of life \'s usual intimacies , and all of its associated life connections for which he so yearns . At the same time , Jake attempts to live a life of meaning and purpose , one crammed full with activity , work , and friendships . Yet it is within this network of friendships and connections that he must confront his painful circumstances . Enter his true love , the feckless Lady Ashley , and indeed the plot thickens , for we soon see how Jake \'s physical affliction has painfully affected several others . Ashley loves him , but needs a virile man who can give her the physical love she needs . While Ashley is a woman of uncommon beauty , she is also virtuous enough in her won way to want the one man she truly loves to be her lover . Like all of us , she wants most that which she can never have , and so she returns to the source of her own dilemma time after time to Jake , her emotional match , the one man who can not give her the mature emotional love she craves . So they are condemned to circle around each other , even while some of their friends and other members of the in-crowd interfere , compete , and seek Ashley \'s affections around the edges of the continuing affair . What we are left with is a modern tragedy , one in which the characters must somehow resolve the irresolvable . Yet for all this emotional turmoil and existential ` sturm-und-drang \' of the so-called `` lost generation \'\' , people drowning in the moral anomie and circumstantial wasteland created in the gutters of their own endless wants and needs , it is most often Hemingway \'s imaginative and spare use of the language itself that wins the reader over . Unlike his predecessors , he sought a lean narrative style that cut away at all the flowery description and endless adjectives . In the process of parsing away the excesses , Hemingway created a clear , simple and quite declarative prose style that was truly both modern and revolutionary . What one encounters as a result is a story seemingly stripped to its barest essentials , superficially more like the newspaper man \'s pantheon of who , what , where , when , and why , and yet somehow transformed into a much more accurate and imaginative effort , one leaving the reader with a much more artful account of what is going on . One reads Hemingway quickly , at least at first , when one learns to slow down and drink in every word and every detail as it is related . For me and for millions of others , the true genius of Hemingway is to be found in his artful use of language . This book was Hemingway \'s first truly successful foray into the world of letters , and the result changed the face of modern fiction . Enjoy ! ',normal

835,20_6_R2XYMQOPUJPPU9.txt,' This gets 0 stars because it is a rip off of Battle Royale by Koushin Takami . Everyone \'s buzzing over this `` unique \'\' `` gritty \'\' compelling story that \'s `` Lord of the Flies \'\' meets `` 1984 \'\' , but I would like everyone to know that this is not any new concept . And further more you will be much more please with the ending of Battle Royale than Hunger Games , because Battle Royale \'s ending is the perfect ending , with a twist , that no book can beat . Plus , Battle Royale does n\'t throw in a love story just to have a love story . Suzanne Collins throws in a `` teen \'\' American romance that does n\'t reflect real romantic pressures of teenagers . It just does not work . You may still enjoy this book but you will be much more satisfied reading Battle Royale by Koushin Takami ',normal
1214,20_14_RKN6H3IRB2JVM.txt,' The Optoma EP727 projector was much smaller than we expected , and very lightweight , but it did n\'t feel flimsy at all , just solid and well-built . We bought this to use for a theatre show . The set largely consisted of slides projected onto a backdrop , and we were worried about having the slides bright and sharp , despite the long throw and the bright stage lights illuminating the actors . No trouble - this was great ! We fastened the projector up on the lighting bar , and strung a 50 \' VGA cable up , over , and down to the controlling computer ( an old G3 Apple iBook ) . It worked flawlessly . We were not certain the remote would work from that distance ( the projector was 20 \' in the air ) but we had no problem turning the machine on and off remotely . The keystoning feature was very useful , since we were projecting from well above the stage . The projector had no trouble with long \'on \' times . It was on continuously for about 5 hours during the dress rehersal , and for about 2 hours for each performance . I was really impressed when it recovered without a hiccup when we triggered a circuit breaker and the power went out . That happened twice ; once during rehersal and once during a performance . In fact , the only complaint I have at all is that the projector boots while projecting the name `` Optoma \'\' , then hunts for the computer signal . If it were n\'t for that , I \'m sure the audience would not have noticed when the circuit blew during the performance ( it was during a transition in the play , and a blackout might have been appropriate ) . As it was , it only took a minute or so to get fully operational again . We did not use the DVI input for this show , but I tried it with my home computer ( which has a DVI video out ) and the projector image looked especially sharp . Basically , I love it . ',normal
43,21_2_R2K2LPEAN3MYN3.txt,' First off , I \'m an otherwise very happy Xbox Live Gold member . Instead of buying a points card from a retailer , I made the mistake of buying the points online from Microsoft through the Xbox . I used my gamer tag account and entered my credit card on the TV and I bought 500 points . I got the email confirmation that I bought the points . I then used the points . So far so good . Over the next two days , four other Xbox charges totaling $ 30 mysteriously appeared on my credit card . Someone bought more points and a game subscription using my credit card info . I called Xbox Live support- their answer was `` we do n\'t give refunds . \'\' I explained that it \'s not a REFUND if my account is used fradulently . They still said no . Note that clearly the security leak was with them , as no other fraudulent charges appeared on my credit card ... just Xbox charges . I then asked them to delete my credit card info from my Xbox Live account . They said they could not do this . I could not believe this ! Given that someone had access to my credit card and they were unwilling to remove my credit card info , I had no choice but to cancel my credit card . My advice- buy the points from a trusted source like Amazon . Do n\'t ever give Microsoft direct access to your credit card info . I hope this helps . ',normal
283,49_7_RTOQPY4ACOU7L.txt,' For starters Amazon delivers on their promise of a 3-day delivery . This is a company you can count on . The Zx1 is right on target . Right out of the box it does exactly what you would expect from a small pocket video camera - decent quality and simple operation . Even indoors the quality was acceptable - which is more than you can say about most cameras in this class . This is clearly a second-generation pocket video camera - with improved controls and support for large capacity SD cards . The AA batteries are just what you need to make sure you will never run out . I was surprised to see that a charger was included . My big concern about buying a Flash Drive HD camera was the issue of file format . This is a thorny issue with all HD video cameras . I could care lass about HD - I just wanted decent quality and the ability to edit video . The plan is simple - archive the \'HD \' content and keep it for future editing when software and hardware are readily available . And meanwhile convert the files to AVI or another usable DVD formtat for immediate use . The supplied ArcSoft program does primitive conversion of the 720p format to 640 DVD format - but in Quicktime - which Windows Media player version 9 still refuses to recognize in Windows XP ( I hate Vista ) There are many third party programs which do a better job of conversion - the one I use is AVS Video Converter 6 . It took the raw MOV file from the SD card and converted it to AVI format with the 720 lines preserved and good sound quality . As with all such conversions it is slow but the quality is excellent . This is not a trivial conversion . Of course AVS will convert it to any of a dozen other formats - some with smaller file size - but none with higher quality . Since this camera is so new , the Kodak web site has very limited documentation for the Zx1 . They avoid entirely the issue of file formats and that is because it is a thorny issue . Along these lines I should mention that without loading any software , you can slip the SD card in your computer slot and you will get a MOV file . It comes up as a Quicktime file . My version of Quicktime played the movie O.K but there was no sound . I \'m sure an update is available - but it may not be free . Of course my Quicktime player did play the MOV file after it was converted by ArcSoft . Hey for $ 150 - this is a great buy and it seems to be durable also . ',normal
686,51_5_R2EBKFUH501ITO.txt,' `` Oh my God ! He \'s so hot when he \'s wet ! \'\' was the first thing I heard from the squealing 13 year old girl seated next to me as this movie started in the theater , and yes , Percy Jackson ( the son of Poseidon ) was frequently wet throughout this movie . I also heard other variations on this exclamation , ranging from `` He \'s so hot when he sweats \'\' to `` He \'s even hot when he bleeds ! \'\' and although I agreed wholeheartedly with the young lady to my left , this movie has a lot more going for it than the fantastic eye candy that is Logan Lerman . The movie is a great adventure filled with plenty of suspense and cleaver and funny dialogue . It also includes one of my favorite scenes in a movie released within the last five years , which I will only describe with the words `` Poker Face \'\' so as not to spoil it for any new viewers . Yes , there are a several over-the-top or wooden performances from a few of the adult actors ( Pierce Brosnan , coming off as more of a creepy child molester than the Dumbledore-like figure of wisdom and guidance he hopes to be ) but the young actors playing Percy , Grover , Annabeth and Luke were fantastic in their roles . This movie was so much fun ; I wound up seeing it 4 times in the theater with a friend of mine who also fell in love with it . I had never read the books before , but I am grateful to this movie for inspiring me to read the Percy Jackson series , which is better quality than the film . However , as far as entertainment value goes , you ca n\'t beat this movie . ',normal
606,30_6_R3JCKOSOR7AJCQ.txt,' There is a thin line between love and hate , and once Heathcliff crosses it , we see a grand , passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug . Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate , Catherine Earnshaw , Heathcliff turns his devastation outward , becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village . Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff , only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother . Meanwhile , Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff , for although she once rejected him , she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy . Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks , `` Why did you betray your heart , Cathy ? \'\' Sound depressing ? It \'s not . Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love , for good and ill . But more importantly , it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one \'s heart , rather than one \'s head . Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day , not only would the two of them been much happier , but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off . Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters , and for me that is quite true . That \'s the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights , because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does , you know that you are not alone , and that some things transcend time and place . Think about it -- a prim , Victorian preacher \'s daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century . Pretty amazing , and highly recommended . ',normal

898,15_1_R9QZGK0OY6I9B.txt,' Anybody who is familiar with Eric Alterman \'s conservative bashing and rantings from `` The Nation \'\' and `` Altercation \'\' on MSNBC.COM will be instantly familiar with this book . Eric \'s leanings are so far to the left that he makes Bill and Hillary Clinton look conservative . Most of Eric \'s writings are obviously filled with hate for George W. Bush . If the President said the sky was blue , Eric \'s column in `` The Nation \'\' or `` Altercation \'\' on MSNBC.com would say the sky was Red . Eric \'s rantings are so skewed to the left , that it \'s easy to see that his book is fired by his hatred for anything conservative and how he twists the facts to justify his point . Anybody who watches CNN , MSNBC , or any the major network broadcasts can obviously tell that the Liberals are in control of the networks and their broadcast agenda . Fox News is the only network that offers an honest and fair presentation of the news without the obvious liberal bias of the other media news shows . Also Eric forgets to tell us that Liberals are in control of most major newspapers in the United STates . It \'s obvious to anyone who reads a newspaper in the United States . Also MSNBC.com has a leftist bias . Eric Alterman \'s `` Altercation \'\' and Jill Nelson \'s op-ed pieces on MSNBC.com show just how liberal msnbc.com is in it \'s news reporting . Eric has no regard for the United States . He \'s typical of the liberals in Ann Coulter \'s book `` Treason \'\' that wish to destroy the United States from within . Eric has no regard for United States law unless it can be twisted to serve his politically correct and leftist anti-american agenda . Eric thinks he knows more about Constitutional law than the Supreme Court when he says that the Supreme Court was wrong and George W. Bush is the Commander in Theif . Eric forgets to tell us that the US Supreme Court stepped in to stop the Democratic controlled Florida Supreme Court from rewriting election law after the fact of the election to help Al Gore steal the election from George W. Bush . The Democratic controlled Florida Supreme court was guilty of changing the rules after the election has occured which violates Federal Election Law and the US Constitution . Eric also conveniently forgets to tell us that the President is determined by the electoral college and not the popular vote . It \'s in the constitution , yet he conveniently overlooks things that disagree with his leftist liberal and anti-american viewpoints . Eric Alterman \'s documentation standards practice the normal liberal method of cross polination . Cross pollination is when one liberal writes an article or book with no factual backing and then another liberal author references the book to back up his non-truthful claims . Very little of Eric \'s documenation for his book comes from the mainstream media or verifiable sources . Most of his documentation comes from unverifiable questionable sources in the liberal community . The footnotes and endnotes look real impressive if you do n\'t question their validity or their sources . Most of his footnotes and endnotes come from nonverifable sources and have very little factual support behind them . Anybody who wasted their money on Eric \'s rantings deserves their money back .

1204,48_5_R2IQUWG5R0SG0B.txt,' I did not think I needed yet another remote control because I thought the six-axis had everything it needed for movie playing on the PS3 and , yet , I bought one . There were 2 initial reasons : - my wife was missing a \'magic wand \' shaped remote for playing movies - Amazon had it at a great price in one of them lightning deals I ended up using it myself and , in fact , using it for more than just movie playing - see below . But , let \'s do a quick inventory of features : = It \'s blue-tooth enabled and , therefore , it \'s not taking any ports on your PS3 . This is probably important for anyone who has a `` 2-USB ports console \'\' . = It \'s wand-shaped , allowing the non-gamers to control their movie-watching activities while holding a familiar-shaped device in their hand . = It maps ALL the six-axis buttons and performs everything a six-axis would do , except for the joystick features of R3 and L3 ( but you do have the push-down or \'click \' abilities for them ) . = 2 AA battery powered ( still with the original Sony batteries after 4 months of use ) = Includes additional buttons that the movie-only users would expect on a remote such as : + a number pad + eject + red , green , blue , yellow buttons + play , stop , pause + slow ( step ) , scan ( left/right ) , prev/next + display , top menu , pop up menu , return + subtitles , angle , audio What is interesting about this remote is that you can use it for much more than movie-playing . Given that it has all the six-axis buttons , guess what ? You can use it , and I do use it to : - surf the web - play music - shop at the PSN store - play certain games such as Sudoku - turn the PS3 on/off when your six-axis controllers are in the charger and I am playing GT5 that is using a racing wheel And , yes , you CAN turn the PS3 on and off with this remote . Turning it on is easy - you simply press the PlayStation button and the PS3 turns itself on . To turn it off , you either go as far to the left on the X-bar and all the way up and press Enter ( the turn-off PlayStation icon will be highlighted ) or you simply hold the PlayStation button pressed for a few seconds and then select \'yes \' and press the X button a couple of times . Overall : I am happy with this peripheral . Yes , it \'s one more remote control but it \'s a pretty good one , for the reasons I stated above . _______________________________ Notes - Aug 29 , 2009 , after 16 months of use I find that I \'m using the remote more and more , not only for playing movies but for navigating the XMB and at the PSN Store , also when playing music or slideshows . Due to its very convenient arrows wheel with an \'enter \' button in the middle , navigating the PS3 and doing just about anything other than playing games is a lot easier than using the PS3 game controller . Unlike the controller which normally requires two hands to hold , this is basically a one-hand operation where you hold the remote in one hand and operate the wheel with your thumb . And because it \'s Bluetooth , not IR ( Infrared ) , you do n\'t even need to point it at the PS3 . And , one word on battery life . After about 15-16 months of operation , this is probably the third set of batteries so I \'d estimate battery life to be about 4-6 months . Not too bad . ',normal
